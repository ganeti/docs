  ><h2
    >Version 0.3.1 (Fri, 11 Mar 2011)</h2
    ><p
    >Minor bugfix release:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >Fixed source archive generation: the hscolour.css file was an invalid symlink, and the man pages were not correctly timestamped (leading to unneeded build-time rebuilds)</li
      ><li
      >Improved the Luxi backend to show which attribute fails parsing</li
      ><li
      >Small improvements to the man pages, and also ship the HTML version of man pages in the source archive</li
      ></ul
    ></div
  ><div id="version-0.3.0-fri-04-feb-2011"
  ><h2
    >Version 0.3.0 (Fri, 04 Feb 2011)</h2
    ><p
    >A significant release that breaks compatibility with Ganeti versions below 2.4 due to the node group changes. Only the RAPI backend can talk to older clusters, but it is recommended to use this version only with Ganeti 2.4.</p
    ><p
    >All commands are now multi-group aware (but to various degrees), so allocation, balancing and capacity calculation respects the group layout and will not create “broken” instances by using nodes from different groups.</p
    ><p
    >For a regular, single-group cluster, no changes should be directly visible to the users. A multi-group cluster however will change some things slightly:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >hbal will require a target group to operate on (no cluster-wide balancing yet)</li
      ><li
      >evacuation of (DRBD) instances from a node will be restricted to nodes in the same group, as inter-group moves are not implemented yet</li
      ><li
      >capacity, while showing correct data, will not give per-group details yet</li
      ></ul
    ><p
    >There are other changes in this release:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >fixed a long-standing bug in hscan related to node memory data</li
      ><li
      >changed the text backend format, which unfortunately invalidates old files</li
      ><li
      >error handling improvements, so that invalid input data reports better where the error is</li
      ><li
      >the simulation backend changes its syntax, now it takes the allocation policy too, and can generate multiple groups</li
      ><li
      >(internal) man page generation moved to pandoc from hand-written, which is helpful as it can also generate HTML versions</li
      ><li
      >the balancing algorithm has been changed to work in parallel, if the code is linked against the multi-threaded runtime; this gives a very good speedup (~80% on 4 cores, ~60-70% of 12 cores)</li
      ></ul

  ><div id="version-0.2.8-thu-23-dec-2010"
  ><h2
    >Version 0.2.8 (Thu, 23 Dec 2010)</h2
    ><p
    >A bug fix release:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >fixed balancing function for big clusters, which will improve corner cases where hbal didn't see any solution even though the cluster was obviously not well balanced</li
      ><li
      >fixed exit code of hbal in case of (Luxi) job errors</li
      ><li
      >changed the signal handling in hbal in order to make hbal control easier: instead of synchronising on the count of signals, make SIGINT cause graceful termination, and SIGTERM an immediate one</li
      ><li
      >increased the tag exclusion weight so that it has greater importance during the balancing</li
      ><li
      >slight improvement to the speed of balancing via algorithm tweaks</li
      ></ul
    ></div
  ><div id="version-0.2.7-thu-07-oct-2010"
  ><h2
    >Version 0.2.7 (Thu, 07 Oct 2010)</h2
    ><p
    >Bug fixes:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >fixed the error message for hail multi-evacuation mode</li
      ><li
      >improve evacuation mode for offline secondary nodes (ignore available memory)</li
      ></ul
    ><p
    >New features:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >add a new option <code
	>-S</code
	> to hbal and hspace that saves the cluster state at the end of the processing in the text format used by the <code
	>-t</code
	> option, for later re-processing</li
      ><li
      >a two new options to hbal, -g and --min-gain-limit, that should help in limiting the number of balances steps with a low gain in the final stages</li
      ><li
      >hbal, when executing jobs, will now wait for the current jobs to finish at the first stop (e.g. ^C); if the user wants immediate exit, another signal should be sent</li
      ><li
      >added “normalized” physical CPU units in hspace output (NPU), which represents units of physical CPUs free/used, based on the max-cpu ratio</li
      ></ul
    ></div
  ><div id="version-0.2.6-mon-26-jul-2010"
  ><h2
    >Version 0.2.6 (Mon, 26 Jul 2010)</h2
    ><p
    >Exactly three months since the last release. Many internal changes, plus a couple of important changes in the balancing algorithm.</p
    ><p
    >First, the balancing may now introduce N+1 errors, if this solves other, more critical problems. For the moment, this means that moving instances away from offline nodes is allowed even if it creates N+1 errors, and that means evacuation can be done in more cases.</p
    ><p
    >Second, the scoring for N+1 has changed. In previous versions, it simply counted the number of failing N+1 nodes, which means moving an instance away from a N+1 failed node (but without the node 'clearing' the N+1 status) was not reflected in the cluster score. As such, the balancing algorithm managed to clear N+1 errors only sometimes, since usually it takes more than one move for this, and the first prerequisite move was not 'rewarded' appropriately and thus it was not selected. Now, it is possible to fix many more error cases than before: on a simulated 40 node cluster full with instances (symmetrically allocated on all nodes), around five nodes can be evacuated before N+1 errors can be solved, whereas 0.2.5 could evacuate at best one node.</p
    ><p
    >There were some other internal changes to the scoring algorithm, such that now the metrics have associated weights, and they are not all of the same importance anymore. As of now, the only change is that offline instances have a higher weight, which should favour proper node evacuations.</p
    ><p
    >Among the other changes:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >fixed the hspace KM_POOL_* metrics, which were returned as the final state and not as the delta between the initial and final states</li
      ><li
      >fixed hspace handling of N+1 failing clusters: before, it used to generate a 'fake' response, and the structure of this response was not always in sync with the real responses, leading to missing items; currently it proceeds correctly through the code (skipping the computation), and uses the same display mechanisms as the normal case</li
      ><li
      >fixed hscan exit code for RAPI failures: previously it finished with success even if all the clusters failed, which was creating issues with the live-test script; now it exits with exit code 2 for RAPI failures (unfortunately this is still not optimal as LUXI failures will use exit code 1, the same as the command line)</li
      ><li
      >changed the limit values for CPU/disk, which previously were used optionally, whereas now they are always used; the default cpu ratio limit is now 64 VCPUs per PCPU</li
      ><li
      >changed the internal handling of the short name vs. original (Ganeti-provided) name; now internally we always use the full name, and only in display routines we show the shortened (called 'alias') name; as a result, the -O and --excluded-instances options now accept both the full name and the shortened name</li
      ><li
      >changed internal handling of JSON conversions and errors, such that now we show a better context for failure messages, which should help with diagnosing the malformed message</li
      ><li
      >changed the names for a few node fields, and added some more nodes; this is most likely to help with debugging, and not with regular operation though</li
      ><li
      >changed the node fields option to allow the '+' prefix to mean 'extend the default fields list' rather than start from fresh (similar to Ganeti's implementation)</li
      ><li
      >a few internal changes related to the LUXI protocol implementation, which should make it more safe against potential bugs, one optiomization that should help with large messages, and some patches in preparation for potential expansion of the LUXI backend functionality</li
      ></ul
    ><p
    >And finally, many improvements on unittests and the live-test script. Test coverage is much enhanced, and the test infrastructure has better error reporting; this should lead down-the-road to better code and fewer bugs…</p

  ><h2
    >Version 0.2.5 (Mon, 26 Apr 2010)</h2
    ><p
    >Some internal cleanup plus a few user-visible changes:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >new option for marking instances as 'do-not-move' during rebalancing</li
      ><li
      >allow <code
	>hscan</code
	> to scan the local cluster via Luxi</li
      ><li
      >add more metrics to <code
	>hspace</code
	> which show the delta between original state and final state better (only valid for tiered allocation)</li

  ><h2
    >Version 0.2.4 (Mon, 22 Feb 2010)</h2
    ><p
    >Two improvements for node evacuation:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >hbal takes a new parameter <code
	>--evac-mode</code
	> that restricts the instances to be moved to the ones on offline/drained nodes, which should reduce the work done</li
      ><li
      >hail supports the new <code
	>multi-evacuate</code
	> mode of the IAllocator protocol, that will be released in a minor release on the Ganeti 2.1 branch</li
      ></ul

  ><div id="version-0.2.3-thu-4-feb-2010"
  ><h2
    >Version 0.2.3 (Thu, 4 Feb 2010)</h2
    ><p
    >A small release:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >Fixes selection of secondary node: previously, if the cluster had many N+1 failures, a N+1 failed node could be selected as secondary even if it did not have enough memory to allow the instance to be migrated/failed over to it; this is bad for automated tools, since we can get the cluster in an unhealthy state</li
      ><li
      >Switch the text backend to a single input file, that is generated now by hscan and shouldn't be generated manually via gnt-node/instance list anymore; this allows richer information to be kept in the file, and simplifies a little the internals of the text backend</li
      ></ul
    ></div
  ><div id="version-0.2.2-tue-29-dec-2009"
  ><h2
    >Version 0.2.2 (Tue, 29 Dec 2009)</h2
    ><p
    >Small release, 0.2.1 was broken and thus this was released earlier:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >Release 0.2.1 broke the LUXI backend due to a typo, fixed</li
      ><li
      >Added a live-test script that should catch errors like the above one in the future (needs a working, non-empty cluster)</li
      ><li
      >Changed RAPI and LUXI backends to treat drained nodes as offline, similar to the IAllocator backend change in 0.2.0 (which was wrongly marked as affecting all backends)</li
      ><li
      >Changed the metrics for offline instances and N1 score from percent to count, in order to increase the priority of evacuations</li
      ><li
      >Added a new metric (offline primary instances) which should fix the evacuation of a offline node in a 2-node cluster</li
      ></ul

  ><div id="version-0.2.1-wed-2-dec-2009"
  ><h2
    >Version 0.2.1 (Wed, 2 Dec 2009)</h2
    ><ul
    ><li
      >Added instance exclusion defined via instance tags</li

      >Fixed the output of hspace to be again parseable from the shell</li

  ><div id="version-0.2.0-tue-10-nov-2009"
  ><h2
    >Version 0.2.0 (Tue, 10 Nov 2009)</h2
    ><p
    >A significant release, with a few new major features:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >Added direct execution of the hbal solution when using the Luxi backend; the steps for each instance moves are submitted as a single jobs, and the different jobs are submitted as groups in order to parallelise the execution of moves</li
      ><li
      >Added support for balancing based on dynamic utilisation data for instances, fed in via a text file; by default, all instances are considered equal and this change also improves the equalisation of secondary instances per node</li
      ><li
      >Added support for tiered capacity calculation in hspace, where we start from a maximum instance spec and decrease the spec when we run out of resources; this should give a better measure of available capacity on 'fragmented' clusters; this is done separately from the current fixed-mode computation</li
      ></ul
    ><p
    >Also there have been many minor improvements:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >Added option for showing instances (“--print-instances”), similar to the print nodes option</li
      ><li
      >Added support for customising the node list via an argument to the print nodes option in the form of a comma-separated list of field names; currently the field names are not documented, expecting further changes in a next release</li
      ><li
      >Enhanced the error reporting in the Luxi and Rapi backends</li
      ><li
      >Changed the handling of drained nodes, now being treated the same as offline nodes, for Ganeti 2.0.4+ compatibility</li
      ><li
      >A number of internal changes, simplifying code and merging some disparate functions</li
      ><li
