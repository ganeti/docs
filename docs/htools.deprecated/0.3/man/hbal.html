  >DESCRIPTION</h1
  ><p
  >hbal is a cluster balancer that looks at the current state of the cluster (nodes with their total and free disk, memory, etc.) and instance placement and computes a series of steps designed to bring the cluster into a better state.</p
  ><p
  >The algorithm used is designed to be stable (i.e. it will give you the same results when restarting it from the middle of the solution) and reasonably fast. It is not, however, designed to be a perfect algorithm--it is possible to make it go into a corner from which it can find no improvement, because it looks only one &quot;step&quot; ahead.</p
  ><p
  >By default, the program will show the solution incrementally as it is computed, in a somewhat cryptic format; for getting the actual Ganeti command list, use the <strong
    >-C</strong
    > option.</p
  ><div id="algorithm"
  ><h2
    >ALGORITHM</h2
    ><p
    >The program works in independent steps; at each step, we compute the best instance move that lowers the cluster score.</p
    ><p
    >The possible move type for an instance are combinations of failover/migrate and replace-disks such that we change one of the instance nodes, and the other one remains (but possibly with changed role, e.g. from primary it becomes secondary). The list is:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >failover (f)</li
      ><li
      >replace secondary (r)</li
      ><li
      >replace primary, a composite move (f, r, f)</li
      ><li
      >failover and replace secondary, also composite (f, r)</li
      ><li
      >replace secondary and failover, also composite (r, f)</li
      ></ul
    ><p
    >We don't do the only remaining possibility of replacing both nodes (r,f,r,f or the equivalent f,r,f,r) since these move needs an exhaustive search over both candidate primary and secondary nodes, and is O(n*n) in the number of nodes. Furthermore, it doesn't seems to give better scores but will result in more disk replacements.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="placement-restrictions"
  ><h2
    >PLACEMENT RESTRICTIONS</h2
    ><p
    >At each step, we prevent an instance move if it would cause:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >a node to go into N+1 failure state</li
      ><li
      >an instance to move onto an offline node (offline nodes are either read from the cluster or declared with <em
	>-O</em
	>)</li
      ><li
      >an exclusion-tag based conflict (exclusion tags are read from the cluster and/or defined via the <em
	>--exclusion-tags</em
	> option)</li
      ><li
      >a max vcpu/pcpu ratio to be exceeded (configured via <em
	>--max-cpu</em
	>)</li
      ><li
      >min disk free percentage to go below the configured limit (configured via <em
	>--min-disk</em
	>)</li
      ></ul
    ></div
  ><div id="cluster-scoring"
  ><h2
    >CLUSTER SCORING</h2
    ><p
    >As said before, the algorithm tries to minimise the cluster score at each step. Currently this score is computed as a sum of the following components:</p
    ><ul
    ><li
      >standard deviation of the percent of free memory</li
      ><li
      >standard deviation of the percent of reserved memory</li
      ><li
      >standard deviation of the percent of free disk</li
      ><li
      >count of nodes failing N+1 check</li
      ><li
      >count of instances living (either as primary or secondary) on offline nodes</li
      ><li
      >count of instances living (as primary) on offline nodes; this differs from the above metric by helping failover of such instances in 2-node clusters</li
      ><li
      >standard deviation of the ratio of virtual-to-physical cpus (for primary instances of the node)</li
      ><li
      >standard deviation of the dynamic load on the nodes, for cpus, memory, disk and network</li
      ></ul
    ><p
    >The free memory and free disk values help ensure that all nodes are somewhat balanced in their resource usage. The reserved memory helps to ensure that nodes are somewhat balanced in holding secondary instances, and that no node keeps too much memory reserved for N+1. And finally, the N+1 percentage helps guide the algorithm towards eliminating N+1 failures, if possible.</p
    ><p
    >Except for the N+1 failures and offline instances counts, we use the standard deviation since when used with values within a fixed range (we use percents expressed as values between zero and one) it gives consistent results across all metrics (there are some small issues related to different means, but it works generally well). The 'count' type values will have higher score and thus will matter more for balancing; thus these are better for hard constraints (like evacuating nodes and fixing N+1 failures). For example, the offline instances count (i.e. the number of instances living on offline nodes) will cause the algorithm to actively move instances away from offline nodes. This, coupled with the restriction on placement given by offline nodes, will cause evacuation of such nodes.</p
    ><p
    >The dynamic load values need to be read from an external file (Ganeti doesn't supply them), and are computed for each node as: sum of primary instance cpu load, sum of primary instance memory load, sum of primary and secondary instance disk load (as DRBD generates write load on secondary nodes too in normal case and in degraded scenarios also read load), and sum of primary instance network load. An example of how to generate these values for input to hbal would be to track <code
      >xm list</code
      > for instances over a day and by computing the delta of the cpu values, and feed that via the <em
      >-U</em
      > option for all instances (and keep the other metrics as one). For the algorithm to work, all that is needed is that the values are consistent for a metric across all instances (e.g. all instances use cpu% to report cpu usage, and not something related to number of CPU seconds used if the CPUs are different), and that they are normalised to between zero and one. Note that it's recommended to not have zero as the load value for any instance metric since then secondary instances are not well balanced.</p
    ><p
    >On a perfectly balanced cluster (all nodes the same size, all instances the same size and spread across the nodes equally), the values for all metrics would be zero. This doesn't happen too often in practice :)</p
    ></div
  ><div id="offline-instances"
  ><h2
    >OFFLINE INSTANCES</h2
    ><p
    >Since current Ganeti versions do not report the memory used by offline (down) instances, ignoring the run status of instances will cause wrong calculations. For this reason, the algorithm subtracts the memory size of down instances from the free node memory of their primary node, in effect simulating the startup of such instances.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="exclusion-tags"
  ><h2
    >EXCLUSION TAGS</h2
    ><p
    >The exclusion tags mechanism is designed to prevent instances which run the same workload (e.g. two DNS servers) to land on the same node, which would make the respective node a SPOF for the given service.</p
    ><p
    >It works by tagging instances with certain tags and then building exclusion maps based on these. Which tags are actually used is configured either via the command line (option <em
      >--exclusion-tags</em
      >) or via adding them to the cluster tags:</p
    ><dl
    ><dt
      >--exclusion-tags=a,b</dt
      ><dd
      ><p
	>This will make all instance tags of the form <em
	  >a:*</em
	  >, <em
	  >b:*</em
	  > be considered for the exclusion map</p
	></dd
      ><dt
      >cluster tags <em
	>htools:iextags:a</em
	>, <em
	>htools:iextags:b</em
	></dt
      ><dd
      ><p
	>This will make instance tags <em
	  >a:*</em
	  >, <em
	  >b:*</em
	  > be considered for the exclusion map. More precisely, the suffix of cluster tags starting with <em
	  >htools:iextags:</em
	  > will become the prefix of the exclusion tags.</p
	></dd
      ></dl
    ><p
    >Both the above forms mean that two instances both having (e.g.) the tag <em
      >a:foo</em
      > or <em
      >b:bar</em
      > won't end on the same node.</p
    ></div

    ><dd
    ><p
      >Print the command list at the end of the run. Without this, the program will only show a shorter, but cryptic output.</p
      ><p
      >Note that the moves list will be split into independent steps, called &quot;jobsets&quot;, but only for visual inspection, not for actually parallelisation. It is not possible to parallelise these directly when executed via &quot;gnt-instance&quot; commands, since a compound command (e.g. failover and replace-disks) must be executed serially. Parallel execution is only possible when using the Luxi backend and the <em
	>-L</em
	> option.</p
      ><p
      >The algorithm for splitting the moves into jobsets is by accumulating moves until the next move is touching nodes already touched by the current moves; this means we can't execute in parallel (due to resource allocation in Ganeti) and thus we start a new jobset.</p
