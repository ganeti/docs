<h1>Version 0.2.8 (Thu, 23 Dec 2010)</h1>
<p>A bug fix release:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>fixed balancing function for big clusters, which will improve corner
cases where hbal didn't see any solution even though the cluster was
obviously not well balanced</li>
<li>fixed exit code of hbal in case of (Luxi) job errors</li>
<li>changed the signal handling in hbal in order to make hbal control
easier: instead of synchronising on the count of signals, make SIGINT
cause graceful termination, and SIGTERM an immediate one</li>
<li>increased the tag exclusion weight so that it has greater importance
during the balancing</li>
<li>slight improvement to the speed of balancing via algorithm tweaks</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-2-7-thu-07-oct-2010">
<h1>Version 0.2.7 (Thu, 07 Oct 2010)</h1>
<p>Bug fixes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>fixed the error message for hail multi-evacuation mode</li>
<li>improve evacuation mode for offline secondary nodes (ignore available
memory)</li>
</ul>
<p>New features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>add a new option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-S</span></tt> to hbal and hspace that saves the cluster
state at the end of the processing in the text format used by the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-t</span></tt> option, for later re-processing</li>
<li>a two new options to hbal, -g and --min-gain-limit, that should help
in limiting the number of balances steps with a low gain in the final
stages</li>
<li>hbal, when executing jobs, will now wait for the current jobs to
finish at the first stop (e.g. ^C); if the user wants immediate exit,
another signal should be sent</li>
<li>added “normalized” physical CPU units in hspace output (NPU), which
represents units of physical CPUs free/used, based on the max-cpu
ratio</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-2-6-mon-26-jul-2010">
<h1>Version 0.2.6 (Mon, 26 Jul 2010)</h1>
<p>Exactly three months since the last release. Many internal changes, plus
a couple of important changes in the balancing algorithm.</p>
<p>First, the balancing may now introduce N+1 errors, if this solves other,
more critical problems. For the moment, this means that moving instances
away from offline nodes is allowed even if it creates N+1 errors, and
that means evacuation can be done in more cases.</p>
<p>Second, the scoring for N+1 has changed. In previous versions, it simply
counted the number of failing N+1 nodes, which means moving an instance
away from a N+1 failed node (but without the node 'clearing' the N+1
status) was not reflected in the cluster score. As such, the balancing
algorithm managed to clear N+1 errors only sometimes, since usually it
takes more than one move for this, and the first prerequisite move was
not 'rewarded' appropriately and thus it was not selected. Now, it is
possible to fix many more error cases than before: on a simulated 40
node cluster full with instances (symmetrically allocated on all nodes),
around five nodes can be evacuated before N+1 errors can be solved,
whereas 0.2.5 could evacuate at best one node.</p>
<p>There were some other internal changes to the scoring algorithm, such
that now the metrics have associated weights, and they are not all of
the same importance anymore. As of now, the only change is that offline
instances have a higher weight, which should favour proper node
evacuations.</p>
<p>Among the other changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>fixed the hspace KM_POOL_* metrics, which were returned as the final
state and not as the delta between the initial and final states</li>
<li>fixed hspace handling of N+1 failing clusters: before, it used to
generate a 'fake' response, and the structure of this response was not
always in sync with the real responses, leading to missing items;
currently it proceeds correctly through the code (skipping the
computation), and uses the same display mechanisms as the normal case</li>
<li>fixed hscan exit code for RAPI failures: previously it finished with
success even if all the clusters failed, which was creating issues
with the live-test script; now it exits with exit code 2 for RAPI
failures (unfortunately this is still not optimal as LUXI failures
will use exit code 1, the same as the command line)</li>
<li>changed the limit values for CPU/disk, which previously were used
optionally, whereas now they are always used; the default cpu ratio
limit is now 64 VCPUs per PCPU</li>
<li>changed the internal handling of the short name vs. original
(Ganeti-provided) name; now internally we always use the full name,
and only in display routines we show the shortened (called 'alias')
name; as a result, the -O and --excluded-instances options now accept
both the full name and the shortened name</li>
<li>changed internal handling of JSON conversions and errors, such that
now we show a better context for failure messages, which should help
with diagnosing the malformed message</li>
<li>changed the names for a few node fields, and added some more nodes;
this is most likely to help with debugging, and not with regular
operation though</li>
<li>changed the node fields option to allow the '+' prefix to mean 'extend
the default fields list' rather than start from fresh (similar to
Ganeti's implementation)</li>
<li>a few internal changes related to the LUXI protocol implementation,
which should make it more safe against potential bugs, one
optiomization that should help with large messages, and some patches
in preparation for potential expansion of the LUXI backend functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, many improvements on unittests and the live-test
script. Test coverage is much enhanced, and the test infrastructure has
better error reporting; this should lead down-the-road to better code
and fewer bugs…</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-2-5-mon-26-apr-2010">
<h1>Version 0.2.5 (Mon, 26 Apr 2010)</h1>
<p>Some internal cleanup plus a few user-visible changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>new option for marking instances as 'do-not-move' during rebalancing</li>
<li>allow <tt class="docutils literal">hscan</tt> to scan the local cluster via Luxi</li>
<li>add more metrics to <tt class="docutils literal">hspace</tt> which show the delta between original
state and final state better (only valid for tiered allocation)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-2-4-mon-22-feb-2010">
<h1>Version 0.2.4 (Mon, 22 Feb 2010)</h1>
<p>Two improvements for node evacuation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>hbal takes a new parameter <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--evac-mode</span></tt> that restricts the
instances to be moved to the ones on offline/drained nodes, which
should reduce the work done</li>
<li>hail supports the new <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">multi-evacuate</span></tt> mode of the IAllocator
protocol, that will be released in a minor release on the Ganeti 2.1
branch</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-2-3-thu-4-feb-2010">
<h1>Version 0.2.3 (Thu,  4 Feb 2010)</h1>
<p>A small release:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixes selection of secondary node: previously, if the cluster had
many N+1 failures, a N+1 failed node could be selected as secondary
even if it did not have enough memory to allow the instance to be
migrated/failed over to it; this is bad for automated tools, since
we can get the cluster in an unhealthy state</li>
<li>Switch the text backend to a single input file, that is generated
now by hscan and shouldn't be generated manually via
gnt-node/instance list anymore; this allows richer information to be
kept in the file, and simplifies a little the internals of the text
backend</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-2-2-tue-29-dec-2009">
<h1>Version 0.2.2 (Tue, 29 Dec 2009)</h1>
<p>Small release, 0.2.1 was broken and thus this was released earlier:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Release 0.2.1 broke the LUXI backend due to a typo, fixed</li>
<li>Added a live-test script that should catch errors like the above one
in the future (needs a working, non-empty cluster)</li>
<li>Changed RAPI and LUXI backends to treat drained nodes as offline,
similar to the IAllocator backend change in 0.2.0 (which was wrongly
marked as affecting all backends)</li>
<li>Changed the metrics for offline instances and N1 score from percent to
count, in order to increase the priority of evacuations</li>
<li>Added a new metric (offline primary instances) which should fix the
evacuation of a offline node in a 2-node cluster</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-2-1-wed-2-dec-2009">
<h1>Version 0.2.1 (Wed,  2 Dec 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added instance exclusion defined via instance tags</li>
<li>Fixed the output of hspace to be again parseable from the shell</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-2-0-tue-10-nov-2009">
<h1>Version 0.2.0 (Tue, 10 Nov 2009)</h1>
<p>A significant release, with a few new major features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added direct execution of the hbal solution when using the Luxi
backend; the steps for each instance moves are submitted as a single
jobs, and the different jobs are submitted as groups in order to
parallelise the execution of moves</li>
<li>Added support for balancing based on dynamic utilisation data for
instances, fed in via a text file; by default, all instances are
considered equal and this change also improves the equalisation of
secondary instances per node</li>
<li>Added support for tiered capacity calculation in hspace, where we
start from a maximum instance spec and decrease the spec when we run
out of resources; this should give a better measure of available
capacity on 'fragmented' clusters; this is done separately from the
current fixed-mode computation</li>
</ul>
<p>Also there have been many minor improvements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added option for showing instances (“--print-instances”), similar to
the print nodes option</li>
<li>Added support for customising the node list via an argument to the
print nodes option in the form of a comma-separated list of field
names; currently the field names are not documented, expecting further
changes in a next release</li>
<li>Enhanced the error reporting in the Luxi and Rapi backends</li>
<li>Changed the handling of drained nodes, now being treated the same as
offline nodes, for Ganeti 2.0.4+ compatibility</li>
<li>A number of internal changes, simplifying code and merging some
disparate functions</li>
<li>Simplify the build system in relation to creation of archives</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-1-8-tue-29-sep-2009">
<h1>Version 0.1.8 (Tue, 29 Sep 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Brown-paper-bag release fixing haddock issues</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-1-7-mon-28-sep-2009">
<h1>Version 0.1.7 (Mon, 28 Sep 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fixed a bug in the Luxi backend for big responses</li>
<li>Fixed test suite exit code in presence of test failures</li>
<li>Changed the migrate operation to run instead failover for instances
which were marked as not running in the input data (this could have
been changed since then, but it's better than today's always migrate)</li>
<li>Added support for 'cheap' moves only (only migrate/failover) in
balancing</li>
<li>Added support for building without curl (thus no RAPI backend)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-1-6-wed-19-aug-2009">
<h1>Version 0.1.6 (Wed, 19 Aug 2009)</h1>

</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-1-5-thu-09-jul-2009">
<h1>Version 0.1.5 (Thu, 09 Jul 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Removed obsolete hn1 program; this allowed removal of a lot of
supporting code</li>
<li>Lots of changes in hspace: the output now is a shell fragment in order
for script to source it or parse it easier; added failure reasons;
optimised to use less memory for large clusters</li>
<li>Optimized the scoring algorithm (used by all tools) so that now
computations should be faster</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-1-4-tue-16-jun-2009">
<h1>Version 0.1.4 (Tue, 16 Jun 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Added CPU count/ratio of virtual-to-physical CPUs to the cluster
scoring methods; this means that now the balancer, the iallocator
plugin and so on will try to keep the VCPU-to-PCPU ratio equal across
the cluster</li>
<li>Fixed some hscan bugs</li>
<li>Fixed the way iallocator reads the total disk size (was broken and it
was always falling back to summing the disk sizes)</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-1-1-tue-26-may-2009">
<h1>Version 0.1.1 (Tue, 26 May 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add a new program, “hail”, which is an iallocator plugin and can
allocate/relocate instances</li>
<li>Experimental support for non-mirrored instances (hail supports them,
hbal should no longer abort when it finds such instances and simply
ignore them)</li>
<li>The RAPI port and/or scheme can be overriden now, and even “<a class="reference external" href="file://">file://</a>”
schemes can be used if the message body has been saved under the
appropriate name</li>
<li>Lots of code reorganization, esp. rewritten loading pipeline</li>
<li>Better data checking and better error messages in case validation
fails; tools now consider nodes with error in input data (‘?’ returned
by ganeti) as offline</li>
<li>Small enhancement to the makefile for simpler packaging</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-1-0-tue-19-may-2009">

<li>Drop compatibility with Ganeti 1.2</li>
<li>Add a new minimum score option (with a very low default), should help
with very good clusters (but is still not optimal)</li>
<li>Add a --quiet option to hbal</li>
<li>Add support for reading offline nodes directly from the cluster</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-0-8-tue-21-apr-2009">
<h1>Version 0.0.8 (Tue, 21 Apr 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>hbal: prevent mismatches in wrong node names being passed to -O, by
aborting in this case</li>
<li>add the ability to write the commands (-C) to a script via (-C&lt;file&gt;),
so that it can be later executed directly; this has also changed the
commands to include the ncessary -f flags to skip confirmations</li>
<li>add checks for extra argument in hbal and hn1, so that unintended
errors are catched</li>
<li>raise the accepted “missing” memory limit to 512MB, to cover usual Xen
reservations</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-0-7-mon-23-mar-2009">
<h1>Version 0.0.7 (Mon, 23 Mar 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>added support for offline nodes, which are not used as targets for
instance relocation and if they hold instances the hbal algorithm will
attempt to relocate these away</li>
<li>added support for offline instances, which now will no longer skew the
free memory estimation of nodes; the algorithm will no longer create
conditions for N+1 failures when such instances are later started</li>
<li>implemented a complete model of node resources, in order to prevent an
unintended re-occurrence of cases like the offline instance were we
miscalculate some node resource; this gives warning now in case the
node reported free disk or free memory deviates by more than a set
amount from the expected value</li>
<li>a new tool <em>hscan</em> that can generate the input text-file for the other
tools by collection via RAPI</li>
<li>some small changes to the build system to make it more friendly; also
included the generated documentation in the source archive</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-0-0-6-mon-16-mar-2009">
<h1>Version 0.0.6 (Mon, 16 Mar 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>re-factored the hbal algorithm to make it stable in the sense that it
gives the same solution when restarted from the middle; barring
rounding of disk/memory and incomplete reporting from Ganeti (for
1.2), it should be now feasible to rely on its output without
generating moves ad infinitum</li>
<li>the hbal algorithm now uses two more variables: the node N+1 failures
and the amount of reserved memory; the first of which tries to ‘fix’
the N+1 status, the latter tries to distribute secondaries more
equally</li>
<li>the hbal algorithm now uses two more moves at each step:
replace+failover and failover+replace (besides the original failover,
replace, and failover+replace+failover)</li>
<li>slightly changed the build system to embed GIT version/tags into the
binaries so that we know for a binary from which tree it was done,
either via ‘--version’ or via “strings hbal|grep version”</li>
<li>changed the solution list and in general the hbal output to be more
clear by default, and changed “gnt-instance failover” to “gnt-instance
migrate”</li>
<li>added man pages for the two binaries</li>

<h1>Version 0.0.5 (Mon, 09 Mar 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a few small improvements for hbal (possibly undone by later changes),
hbal is now quite faster</li>
<li>fix documentation building</li>
<li>allow hbal to work on non N+1 compliant clusters, but without
guarantees that the end cluster will be compliant; in any case, this
should give a smaller number of nodes that are not compliant if the
cluster state permits it</li>
<li>strip common domain suffix from nodes and instances, so that output is
shorter and hopefully clearer</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="version-0-0-4-sun-15-feb-2009">
<h1>Version 0.0.4 (Sun, 15 Feb 2009)</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>better balancing algorithm in hbal</li>
<li>implemented an RAPI collector, now the cluster data can be gathered
automatically via RAPI and doesn't need manual export of node and
instance list</li>

<li>add option to print the needed command list for reaching the proposed
solution</li>
