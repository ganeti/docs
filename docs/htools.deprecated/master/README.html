  >Ganeti Cluster tools (ganeti-htools)</h1
  ><p
  >These are some simple cluster tools for fixing common allocation problems on Ganeti 2.0 clusters.</p
  ><p
  >Note that these tools are most useful for bigger cluster sizes (e.g. more than five or ten machines); at lower sizes, the computations they do can also be done manually.</p
  ><p
  >Most of the tools revolve around the concept of keeping the cluster N+1 compliant: this means that in case of failure of any node, the instances affected can be failed over (via <code
    >gnt-node failover</code
    > or <code
    >gnt-instance failover</code
    >) to their secondary node, and there is enough memory reserved for this operation without needing to shutdown other instances or rebalance the cluster.</p

      >The rebalancer uses a simple algorithm to try to get the nodes of the cluster as equal as possible in their resource usage. It tries to repeatedly move each instance one step, so that the cluster score becomes better. We stop when no further move can improve the score.</p

      ><p
      >The <code

	> iallocator plugin can be used for allocations of mirrored and non-mirrored instances and for relocations of mirrored instances. It needs to be installed in Ganeti's iallocator search pathâ€”usually <code
	>/usr/lib/ganeti/iallocators</code
	> or <code
	>/usr/local/lib/ganeti/iallocators</code
	>, and after that it can be used via ganeti's <code
	>--iallocator</code
	> option (in various gnt-node/gnt-instance commands). See the man page <code
	>hail(1)</code
	> for more details.</p

    >The <code

      > and <code
      >hspace</code
      > programs can either get their input from text files, locally from the master daemon (when run on the master node of a cluster), or remote from a cluster via RAPI. The &quot;-L&quot; argument enables local collection (with an optional path to the unix socket). For online collection via RAPI, the &quot;-m&quot; argument should specify the cluster or master node name. Only <code
      >hbal</code
      > and <code
      >hspace</code
      > use these arguments, <code
      >hail</code
      > uses the standard iallocator API and thus doesn't need any special setup (just needs to be installed in the right directory).</p
    ><p
    >For generating the text files, a separate tool (<code
      >hscan</code
      >) is provided to automate their gathering if RAPI is available, which is better since it can extract more precise information. In case RAPI is not usable for whatever reason, <code
      >gnt-node list</code
      > and <code
      >gnt-instance list</code
      > could be used, and their output concatenated in a single file, separated by one blank line. If you need to do this manually, you'll need to check the sources to see which fields are needed exactly.</p
