Disks

.. contents:: :depth: 4

This is a design document detailing the implementation of disks as a new
top-level citizen in the config file (just like instances, nodes etc).


Current state and shortcomings
==============================

Currently, Disks are stored in Ganeti's config file as a list
(container) of Disk objects under the Instance in which they belong.
This implementation imposes a number of limitations:

* A Disk object cannot live outside an Instance. This means that one
  cannot detach a disk from an instance (without destroying the disk)
  and then reattach it (to the same or even to a different instance).

* Disks are not taggable objects, as only top-level citizens of the
  config file can be made taggable. Having taggable disks will allow for
  further customizations.


Proposed changes
================

The implementation is going to be split in four parts:

* Make disks a top-level citizen in config file. The Instance object
  will no longer contain a list of Disk objects, but a list of disk
  UUIDs.

* Add locks for Disk objects and make them taggable.

* Allow to attach/detach an existing disk to/from an instance.

* Allow creation/modification/deletion of disks that are not attached to
  any instance (requires new LUs for disks).


Design decisions
================

Disks as config top-level citizens
----------------------------------

The first patch-series is going to add a new top-level citizen in the
config object (namely ``disks``) and separate the disk objects from the
instances. In doing so there are a number of problems that we have to
overcome:

* How the Disk object will be represented in the config file and how it
  is going to be connected with the instance it belongs to.

* How the existing code will get the disks belonging to an instance.

* What it means for a disk to be attached/detached to/from an instance.

* How disks are going to be created/deleted, attached/detached using
  the existing code.


Disk representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Disk`` object gets two extra slots, ``_TIMESTAMPS`` and
``serial_no``.

The ``Instance`` object will no longer contain the list of disk objects
that are attached to it. Instead, an Instance object will refer to its
disks using their UUIDs. Since the order in which the disks are attached
to an instance is important we are going to have a list of disk UUIDs
under the Instance object which will denote the disks attached to the
instance and their order at the same time. So the Instance's ``disks``
slot is going to be a list of disk UUIDs. The `Disk` object is not going
to have a slot pointing to the `Instance` in which it belongs since this
is redundant.


Get instance's disks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A new function ``GetInstanceDisks`` will be added to the config that given an
instance will return a list of Disk objects with the disks attached to this
instance. This list will be exactly the same as 'instance.disks' was before.
Everywhere in the code we are going to replace the 'instance.disks' (which from
now one will contain a list of disk UUIDs) with the function
``GetInstanceDisks``.

Since disks will not be part of the `Instance` object any more, 'all_nodes' and
'secondary_nodes' can not be `Instance`'s properties. Instead we will use the
functions ``GetInstanceNodes`` and ``GetInstanceSecondaryNodes`` from the
config to compute these values.


Configuration changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``ConfigData`` object gets one extra slot: ``disks``. Also there
will be two new functions, ``AddDisk`` and ``RemoveDisk`` that will
create/remove a disk objects from the config.

The ``VerifyConfig`` function will be changed so it can check that there
are no dangling pointers from instances to disks (i.e. an instance
points to a disk that doesn't exist in the config).

The 'upgrade' operation for the config should check if disks are top level
citizens and if not it has to extract the disk objects from the instances and
replace them with their uuids. In case of the 'downgrade' operation (where
disks will be made again part of the `Instance` object) all disks that are not
attached to any instance at all will be ignored (removed from config).


Apply Disk modifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are four operations that can be performed to a `Disk` object:

* Create a new `Disk` object and save it to the config.

* Remove an existing `Disk` object from the config.

* Attach an existing `Disk` to an existing `Instance`.

* Detach an existing `Disk` from an existing `Instance`.

The first two operations will be performed using the config functions
``AddDisk`` and ``RemoveDisk`` respectively where the last two operations
will be performed using the functions ``AttachInstanceDisk`` and
``DetachInstanceDisk``.

Since Ganeti doesn't allow for a `Disk` object to not be attached anywhere (for
now) we will create two wrapper functions (namely ``AddInstanceDisk`` and
``RemoveInstanceDisk``) which will add and attach a disk at the same time
(respectively detach and remove a disk).

In addition since Ganeti doesn't allow for a `Disk` object to be attached to
more than one `Instance` at once, when attaching a disk to an instance we have
to make sure that the disk is not attached anywhere else.


Backend changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The backend needs access to the disks of an `Instance` but doesn't have access to
the `GetInstanceDisks` function from the config file. Thus we will create a new
`Instance` slot (namely ``disks_info``) that will get annotated (during RPC)
with the instance's disk objects. So in the backend we will only have to
replace the ``disks`` slot with ``disks_info``.
