<p>Ganeti 1.2 has many scalability issues and restrictions due to its
roots as software for managing small and &#8216;static&#8217; clusters.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 will attempt to remedy first the scalability issues and
then the restrictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Background</a><a class="headerlink" href="#background" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While Ganeti 1.2 is usable, it severely limits the flexibility of the
cluster administration and imposes a very rigid model. It has the
following main scalability issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>only one operation at a time on the cluster <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a></li>
<li>poor handling of node failures in the cluster</li>
<li>mixing hypervisors in a cluster not allowed</li>
</ul>
<p>It also has a number of artificial restrictions, due to historical
design:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>fixed number of disks (two) per instance</li>
<li>fixed number of NICs</li>
</ul>
<table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id2" rules="none">
<colgroup><col class="label" /><col /></colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>Replace disks will release the lock, but this is an exception
and not a recommended way to operate</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The 2.0 version is intended to address some of these problems, and
create a more flexible code base for future developments.</p>
<p>Among these problems, the single-operation at a time restriction is
biggest issue with the current version of Ganeti. It is such a big
impediment in operating bigger clusters that many times one is tempted
to remove the lock just to do a simple operation like start instance
while an OS installation is running.</p>
<div class="section" id="scalability-problems">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Scalability problems</a><a class="headerlink" href="#scalability-problems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ganeti 1.2 has a single global lock, which is used for all cluster
operations.  This has been painful at various times, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is impossible for two people to efficiently interact with a cluster
(for example for debugging) at the same time.</li>
<li>When batch jobs are running it&#8217;s impossible to do other work (for
example failovers/fixes) on a cluster.</li>
</ul>
<p>This poses scalability problems: as clusters grow in node and instance
size it&#8217;s a lot more likely that operations which one could conceive
should run in parallel (for example because they happen on different
nodes) are actually stalling each other while waiting for the global
lock, without a real reason for that to happen.</p>
<p>One of the main causes of this global lock (beside the higher
difficulty of ensuring data consistency in a more granular lock model)
is the fact that currently there is no long-lived process in Ganeti
that can coordinate multiple operations. Each command tries to acquire
the so called <em>cmd</em> lock and when it succeeds, it takes complete
ownership of the cluster configuration and state.</p>
<p>Other scalability problems are due the design of the DRBD device
model, which assumed at its creation a low (one to four) number of
instances per node, which is no longer true with today&#8217;s hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="artificial-restrictions">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Artificial restrictions</a><a class="headerlink" href="#artificial-restrictions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ganeti 1.2 (and previous versions) have a fixed two-disks, one-NIC per
instance model. This is a purely artificial restrictions, but it
touches multiple areas (configuration, import/export, command line)
that it&#8217;s more fitted to a major release than a minor one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="architecture-issues">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Architecture issues</a><a class="headerlink" href="#architecture-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The fact that each command is a separate process that reads the
cluster state, executes the command, and saves the new state is also
an issue on big clusters where the configuration data for the cluster
begins to be non-trivial in size.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Overview</a><a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to solve the scalability problems, a rewrite of the core
design of Ganeti is required. While the cluster operations themselves
won&#8217;t change (e.g. start instance will do the same things, the way
these operations are scheduled internally will change radically.</p>
<p>The new design will change the cluster architecture to:</p>
<img alt="_images/arch-2.0.png" src="_images/arch-2.0.png" />
<p>This differs from the 1.2 architecture by the addition of the master
daemon, which will be the only entity to talk to the node daemons.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="detailed-design">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Detailed design</a><a class="headerlink" href="#detailed-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The changes for 2.0 can be split into roughly three areas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>core changes that affect the design of the software</li>
<li>features (or restriction removals) but which do not have a wide
impact on the design</li>
<li>user-level and API-level changes which translate into differences for
the operation of the cluster</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="core-changes">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Core changes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#core-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The main changes will be switching from a per-process model to a
daemon based model, where the individual gnt-* commands will be
clients that talk to this daemon (see <a class="reference internal" href="#master-daemon">Master daemon</a>). This will
allow us to get rid of the global cluster lock for most operations,
having instead a per-object lock (see <a class="reference internal" href="#granular-locking">Granular locking</a>). Also, the
daemon will be able to queue jobs, and this will allow the individual
clients to submit jobs without waiting for them to finish, and also
see the result of old requests (see <a class="reference internal" href="#job-queue">Job Queue</a>).</p>
<p>Beside these major changes, another &#8216;core&#8217; change but that will not be
as visible to the users will be changing the model of object attribute
storage, and separate that into name spaces (such that an Xen PVM
instance will not have the Xen HVM parameters). This will allow future
flexibility in defining additional parameters. For more details see
<a class="reference internal" href="#object-parameters">Object parameters</a>.</p>
<p>The various changes brought in by the master daemon model and the
read-write RAPI will require changes to the cluster security; we move
away from Twisted and use HTTP(s) for intra- and extra-cluster
communications. For more details, see the security document in the
doc/ directory.</p>
<div class="section" id="master-daemon">
<h4>Master daemon<a class="headerlink" href="#master-daemon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In Ganeti 2.0, we will have the following <em>entities</em>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the master daemon (on the master node)</li>
<li>the node daemon (on all nodes)</li>
<li>the command line tools (on the master node)</li>
<li>the RAPI daemon (on the master node)</li>
</ul>
<p>The master-daemon related interaction paths are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(CLI tools/RAPI daemon) and the master daemon, via the so called
<em>LUXI</em> API</li>
<li>the master daemon and the node daemons, via the node RPC</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some additional interaction paths for exceptional cases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CLI tools might access via SSH the nodes (for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnt-cluster</span> <span class="pre">copyfile</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnt-cluster</span> <span class="pre">command</span></tt>)</li>
<li>master failover is a special case when a non-master node will SSH
and do node-RPC calls to the current master</li>
</ul>
<p>The protocol between the master daemon and the node daemons will be
changed from (Ganeti 1.2) Twisted PB (perspective broker) to HTTP(S),
using a simple PUT/GET of JSON-encoded messages. This is done due to
difficulties in working with the Twisted framework and its protocols
in a multithreaded environment, which we can overcome by using a
simpler stack (see the caveats section).</p>
<p>The protocol between the CLI/RAPI and the master daemon will be a
custom one (called <em>LUXI</em>): on a UNIX socket on the master node, with
rights restricted by filesystem permissions, the CLI/RAPI will talk to
the master daemon using JSON-encoded messages.</p>
<p>The operations supported over this internal protocol will be encoded
via a python library that will expose a simple API for its
users. Internally, the protocol will simply encode all objects in JSON
format and decode them on the receiver side.</p>
<p>For more details about the RAPI daemon see <a class="reference internal" href="#remote-api-changes">Remote API changes</a>, and
for the node daemon see <a class="reference internal" href="#node-daemon-changes">Node daemon changes</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-luxi-protocol">
<span id="luxi"></span><h5>The LUXI protocol<a class="headerlink" href="#the-luxi-protocol" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>As described above, the protocol for making requests or queries to the
master daemon will be a UNIX-socket based simple RPC of JSON-encoded
messages.</p>
<p>The choice of UNIX was in order to get rid of the need of
authentication and authorisation inside Ganeti; for 2.0, the
permissions on the Unix socket itself will determine the access
rights.</p>
<p>We will have two main classes of operations over this API:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>cluster query functions</li>
<li>job related functions</li>
</ul>
<p>The cluster query functions are usually short-duration, and are the
equivalent of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">OP_QUERY_*</span></tt> opcodes in Ganeti 1.2 (and they are
internally implemented still with these opcodes). The clients are
guaranteed to receive the response in a reasonable time via a timeout.</p>
<p>The job-related functions will be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>submit job</li>
<li>query job (which could also be categorized in the query-functions)</li>
<li>archive job (see the job queue design doc)</li>
<li>wait for job change, which allows a client to wait without polling</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details of the actual operation list, see the <a class="reference internal" href="#job-queue">Job Queue</a>.</p>
<p>Both requests and responses will consist of a JSON-encoded message
followed by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ETX</span></tt> character (ASCII decimal 3), which is not a
valid character in JSON messages and thus can serve as a message
delimiter. The contents of the messages will be a dictionary with two
fields:</p>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">method:</th><td class="field-body">the name of the method called</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">args:</th><td class="field-body">the arguments to the method, as a list (no keyword arguments allowed)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Responses will follow the same format, with the two fields being:</p>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">success:</th><td class="field-body">a boolean denoting the success of the operation</td>
</tr>
<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">result:</th><td class="field-body">the actual result, or error message in case of failure</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There are two special value for the result field:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>in the case that the operation failed, and this field is a list of
length two, the client library will try to interpret is as an
exception, the first element being the exception type and the second
one the actual exception arguments; this will allow a simple method of
passing Ganeti-related exception across the interface</li>
<li>for the <em>WaitForChange</em> call (that waits on the server for a job to
change status), if the result is equal to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">nochange</span></tt> instead of the
usual result for this call (a list of changes), then the library will
internally retry the call; this is done in order to differentiate
internally between master daemon hung and job simply not changed</li>
</ul>
<p>Users of the API that don&#8217;t use the provided python library should
take care of the above two cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="master-daemon-implementation">
<h5>Master daemon implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#master-daemon-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The daemon will be based around a main I/O thread that will wait for
new requests from the clients, and that does the setup/shutdown of the
other thread (pools).</p>
<p>There will two other classes of threads in the daemon:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>job processing threads, part of a thread pool, and which are
long-lived, started at daemon startup and terminated only at shutdown
time</li>
<li>client I/O threads, which are the ones that talk the local protocol
(LUXI) to the clients, and are short-lived</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="master-startup-failover">
<h5>Master startup/failover<a class="headerlink" href="#master-startup-failover" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>In Ganeti 1.x there is no protection against failing over the master
to a node with stale configuration. In effect, the responsibility of
correct failovers falls on the admin. This is true both for the new
master and for when an old, offline master startup.</p>
<p>Since in 2.x we are extending the cluster state to cover the job queue
and have a daemon that will execute by itself the job queue, we want
to have more resilience for the master role.</p>
<p>The following algorithm will happen whenever a node is ready to
transition to the master role, either at startup time or at node
failover:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">read the configuration file and parse the node list
contained within</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">query all the nodes and make sure we obtain an agreement via
a quorum of at least half plus one nodes for the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we have the latest configuration and job list (as
determined by the serial number on the configuration and
highest job ID on the job queue)</li>
<li>if we are not failing over (but just starting), the
quorum agrees that we are the designated master</li>
<li>if any of the above is false, we prevent the current operation
(i.e. we don&#8217;t become the master)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">at this point, the node transitions to the master role</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">for all the in-progress jobs, mark them as failed, with
reason unknown or something similar (master failed, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since due to exceptional conditions we could have a situation in which
no node can become the master due to inconsistent data, we will have
an override switch for the master daemon startup that will assume the
current node has the right data and will replicate all the
configuration files to the other nodes.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: the above algorithm is by no means an election algorithm; it
is a <em>confirmation</em> of the master role currently held by a node.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="logging">
<h5>Logging<a class="headerlink" href="#logging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The logging system will be switched completely to the standard python
logging module; currently it&#8217;s logging-based, but exposes a different
API, which is just overhead. As such, the code will be switched over
to standard logging calls, and only the setup will be custom.</p>
<p>With this change, we will remove the separate debug/info/error logs,
and instead have always one logfile per daemon model:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>master-daemon.log for the master daemon</li>
<li>node-daemon.log for the node daemon (this is the same as in 1.2)</li>
<li>rapi-daemon.log for the RAPI daemon logs</li>
<li>rapi-access.log, an additional log file for the RAPI that will be
in the standard HTTP log format for possible parsing by other tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the <a class="reference external" href="glossary.html#term-watcher"><em class="xref">watcher</em></a> will only submit jobs to the master for
startup of the instances, its log file will contain less information
than before, mainly that it will start the instance, but not the
results.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="node-daemon-changes">
<h5>Node daemon changes<a class="headerlink" href="#node-daemon-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The only change to the node daemon is that, since we need better
concurrency, we don&#8217;t process the inter-node RPC calls in the node
daemon itself, but we fork and process each request in a separate
child.</p>
<p>Since we don&#8217;t have many calls, and we only fork (not exec), the
overhead should be minimal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="caveats">
<h5>Caveats<a class="headerlink" href="#caveats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A discussed alternative is to keep the current individual processes
touching the cluster configuration model. The reasons we have not
chosen this approach is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the speed of reading and unserializing the cluster state
today is not small enough that we can ignore it; the addition of
the job queue will make the startup cost even higher. While this
runtime cost is low, it can be on the order of a few seconds on
bigger clusters, which for very quick commands is comparable to
the actual duration of the computation itself</li>
<li>individual commands would make it harder to implement a
fire-and-forget job request, along the lines &#8220;start this
instance but do not wait for it to finish&#8221;; it would require a
model of backgrounding the operation and other things that are
much better served by a daemon-based model</li>
</ul>
<p>Another area of discussion is moving away from Twisted in this new
implementation. While Twisted has its advantages, there are also many
disadvantages to using it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>first and foremost, it&#8217;s not a library, but a framework; thus, if
you use twisted, all the code needs to be &#8216;twiste-ized&#8217; and written
in an asynchronous manner, using deferreds; while this method works,
it&#8217;s not a common way to code and it requires that the entire process
workflow is based around a single <em>reactor</em> (Twisted name for a main
loop)</li>
<li>the more advanced granular locking that we want to implement would
require, if written in the async-manner, deep integration with the
Twisted stack, to such an extend that business-logic is inseparable
from the protocol coding; we felt that this is an unreasonable
request, and that a good protocol library should allow complete
separation of low-level protocol calls and business logic; by
comparison, the threaded approach combined with HTTPs protocol
required (for the first iteration) absolutely no changes from the 1.2
code, and later changes for optimizing the inter-node RPC calls
required just syntactic changes (e.g.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rpc.call_...</span></tt> to
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">self.rpc.call_...</span></tt>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Another issue is with the Twisted API stability - during the Ganeti
1.x lifetime, we had to to implement many times workarounds to changes
in the Twisted version, so that for example 1.2 is able to use both
Twisted 2.x and 8.x.</p>
<p>In the end, since we already had an HTTP server library for the RAPI,
we just reused that for inter-node communication.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="granular-locking">
<h4>Granular locking<a class="headerlink" href="#granular-locking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>We want to make sure that multiple operations can run in parallel on a
Ganeti Cluster. In order for this to happen we need to make sure
concurrently run operations don&#8217;t step on each other toes and break the
cluster.</p>
<p>This design addresses how we are going to deal with locking so that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>we preserve data coherency</li>
<li>we prevent deadlocks</li>
<li>we prevent job starvation</li>
</ul>
<p>Reaching the maximum possible parallelism is a Non-Goal. We have
identified a set of operations that are currently bottlenecks and need
to be parallelised and have worked on those. In the future it will be
possible to address other needs, thus making the cluster more and more
parallel one step at a time.</p>
<p>This section only talks about parallelising Ganeti level operations, aka
Logical Units, and the locking needed for that. Any other
synchronization lock needed internally by the code is outside its scope.</p>
<div class="section" id="library-details">
<h5>Library details<a class="headerlink" href="#library-details" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The proposed library has these features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>internally managing all the locks, making the implementation
transparent from their usage</li>
<li>automatically grabbing multiple locks in the right order (avoid
deadlock)</li>
<li>ability to transparently handle conversion to more granularity</li>
<li>support asynchronous operation (future goal)</li>
</ul>
<p>Locking will be valid only on the master node and will not be a
distributed operation. Therefore, in case of master failure, the
operations currently running will be aborted and the locks will be
lost; it remains to the administrator to cleanup (if needed) the
operation result (e.g. make sure an instance is either installed
correctly or removed).</p>
<p>A corollary of this is that a master-failover operation with both
masters alive needs to happen while no operations are running, and
therefore no locks are held.</p>
<p>All the locks will be represented by objects (like
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lockings.SharedLock</span></tt>), and the individual locks for each object
will be created at initialisation time, from the config file.</p>
<p>The API will have a way to grab one or more than one locks at the same
time.  Any attempt to grab a lock while already holding one in the wrong
order will be checked for, and fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-locks">
<h5>The Locks<a class="headerlink" href="#the-locks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>At the first stage we have decided to provide the following locks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>One &#8220;config file&#8221; lock</li>
<li>One lock per node in the cluster</li>
<li>One lock per instance in the cluster</li>
</ul>
<p>All the instance locks will need to be taken before the node locks, and
the node locks before the config lock. Locks will need to be acquired at
the same time for multiple instances and nodes, and internal ordering
will be dealt within the locking library, which, for simplicity, will
just use alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Each lock has the following three possible statuses:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>unlocked (anyone can grab the lock)</li>
<li>shared (anyone can grab/have the lock but only in shared mode)</li>
<li>exclusive (no one else can grab/have the lock)</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="handling-conversion-to-more-granularity">
<h5>Handling conversion to more granularity<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-conversion-to-more-granularity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>In order to convert to a more granular approach transparently each time
we split a lock into more we&#8217;ll create a &#8220;metalock&#8221;, which will depend
on those sub-locks and live for the time necessary for all the code to
convert (or forever, in some conditions). When a metalock exists all
converted code must acquire it in shared mode, so it can run
concurrently, but still be exclusive with old code, which acquires it
exclusively.</p>
<p>In the beginning the only such lock will be what replaces the current
&#8220;command&#8221; lock, and will acquire all the locks in the system, before
proceeding. This lock will be called the &#8220;Big Ganeti Lock&#8221; because
holding that one will avoid any other concurrent Ganeti operations.</p>
<p>We might also want to devise more metalocks (eg. all nodes, all
nodes+config) in order to make it easier for some parts of the code to
acquire what it needs without specifying it explicitly.</p>
<p>In the future things like the node locks could become metalocks, should
we decide to split them into an even more fine grained approach, but
this will probably be only after the first 2.0 version has been
released.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-removing-locks">
<h5>Adding/Removing locks<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-removing-locks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>When a new instance or a new node is created an associated lock must be
added to the list. The relevant code will need to inform the locking
library of such a change.</p>
<p>This needs to be compatible with every other lock in the system,
especially metalocks that guarantee to grab sets of resources without
specifying them explicitly. The implementation of this will be handled
in the locking library itself.</p>
<p>When instances or nodes disappear from the cluster the relevant locks
must be removed. This is easier than adding new elements, as the code
which removes them must own them exclusively already, and thus deals
with metalocks exactly as normal code acquiring those locks. Any
operation queuing on a removed lock will fail after its removal.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="asynchronous-operations">
<h5>Asynchronous operations<a class="headerlink" href="#asynchronous-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>For the first version the locking library will only export synchronous
operations, which will block till the needed lock are held, and only
fail if the request is impossible or somehow erroneous.</p>
<p>In the future we may want to implement different types of asynchronous
operations such as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>try to acquire this lock set and fail if not possible</li>
<li>try to acquire one of these lock sets and return the first one you
were able to get (or after a timeout) (select/poll like)</li>
</ul>
<p>These operations can be used to prioritize operations based on available
locks, rather than making them just blindly queue for acquiring them.
The inherent risk, though, is that any code using the first operation,
or setting a timeout for the second one, is susceptible to starvation
and thus may never be able to get the required locks and complete
certain tasks. Considering this providing/using these operations should
not be among our first priorities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="locking-granularity">
<h5>Locking granularity<a class="headerlink" href="#locking-granularity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>For the first version of this code we&#8217;ll convert each Logical Unit to
acquire/release the locks it needs, so locking will be at the Logical
Unit level.  In the future we may want to split logical units in
independent &#8220;tasklets&#8221; with their own locking requirements. A different
design doc (or mini design doc) will cover the move from Logical Units
to tasklets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-examples">
<h5>Code examples<a class="headerlink" href="#code-examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>In general when acquiring locks we should use a code path equivalent
to:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">lock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">acquire</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>

  <span class="n">lock</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">release</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This makes sure we release all locks, and avoid possible deadlocks. Of
course extra care must be used not to leave, if possible locked
structures in an unusable state. Note that with Python 2.5 a simpler
syntax will be possible, but we want to keep compatibility with Python
2.4 so the new constructs should not be used.</p>
<p>In order to avoid this extra indentation and code changes everywhere in
the Logical Units code, we decided to allow LUs to declare locks, and
then execute their code with their locks acquired. In the new world LUs
are called like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># user passed names are expanded to the internal lock/resource name,</span>

<h5>Caveats<a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This library will provide an easy upgrade path to bring all the code to
granular locking without breaking everything, and it will also guarantee
against a lot of common errors. Code switching from the old &#8220;lock
everything&#8221; lock to the new system, though, needs to be carefully
scrutinised to be sure it is really acquiring all the necessary locks,
and none has been overlooked or forgotten.</p>
<p>The code can contain other locks outside of this library, to synchronise
other threaded code (eg for the job queue) but in general these should
be leaf locks or carefully structured non-leaf ones, to avoid deadlock
race conditions.</p>

values for hypervisor parameters that are not defined/overridden by

<div class="section" id="instance-parameters">
<h5>Instance parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#instance-parameters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>

instance proper parameters, unique to each instance, instance
hypervisor parameters and instance backend parameters.</p>
<p>The “hvparams” and “beparams” are kept in two dictionaries at instance
level. Only non-default parameters are stored (but once customized, a
parameter will be kept, even with the same value as the default one,
until reset).</p>
<p>The names for hypervisor parameters in the instance.hvparams subtree
should be choosen as generic as possible, especially if specific
parameters could conceivably be useful for more than one hypervisor,
e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">instance.hvparams.vnc_console_port</span></tt> instead of using both
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">instance.hvparams.hvm_vnc_console_port</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">instance.hvparams.kvm_vnc_console_port</span></tt>.</p>
<p>There are some special cases related to disks and NICs (for example):
a disk has both Ganeti-related parameters (e.g. the name of the LV)
and hypervisor-related parameters (how the disk is presented to/named
in the instance). The former parameters remain as proper-instance
parameters, while the latter value are migrated to the hvparams
structure. In 2.0, we will have only globally-per-instance such
hypervisor parameters, and not per-disk ones (e.g. all NICs will be
exported as of the same type).</p>
<p>Starting from the 1.2 list of instance parameters, here is how they
will be mapped to the three classes of parameters:</p>

the last resort, we will need to rollback and keep 1.2 style.</p>
<p>Another problem is that classification of one parameter is unclear
(e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">network_port</span></tt>, is this BE or HV?); in this case we&#8217;ll take
the risk of having to move parameters later between classes.</p>

<h4>Node flags<a class="headerlink" href="#node-flags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Ganeti 2.0 adds three node flags that change the way nodes are handled
within Ganeti and the related infrastructure (iallocator interaction,
RAPI data export).</p>
<div class="section" id="master-candidate-flag">
<h5><em>master candidate</em> flag<a class="headerlink" href="#master-candidate-flag" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Ganeti 2.0 allows more scalability in operation by introducing
parallelization. However, a new bottleneck is reached that is the
synchronization and replication of cluster configuration to all nodes
in the cluster.</p>
<p>This breaks scalability as the speed of the replication decreases
roughly with the size of the nodes in the cluster. The goal of the
master candidate flag is to change this O(n) into O(1) with respect to
job and configuration data propagation.</p>
<p>Only nodes having this flag set (let&#8217;s call this set of nodes the
<em>candidate pool</em>) will have jobs and configuration data replicated.</p>
<p>The cluster will have a new parameter (runtime changeable) called
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">candidate_pool_size</span></tt> which represents the number of candidates the
cluster tries to maintain (preferably automatically).</p>
<p>This will impact the cluster operations as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>jobs and config data will be replicated only to a fixed set of nodes</li>
<li>master fail-over will only be possible to a node in the candidate pool</li>
<li>cluster verify needs changing to account for these two roles</li>
<li>external scripts will no longer have access to the configuration
file (this is not recommended anyway)</li>
</ul>
<p>The caveats of this change are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>if all candidates are lost (completely), cluster configuration is
lost (but it should be backed up external to the cluster anyway)</li>
<li>failed nodes which are candidate must be dealt with properly, so
that we don&#8217;t lose too many candidates at the same time; this will be
reported in cluster verify</li>
<li>the &#8216;all equal&#8217; concept of ganeti is no longer true</li>
<li>the partial distribution of config data means that all nodes will
have to revert to ssconf files for master info (as in 1.2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>speed on a 100+ nodes simulated cluster is greatly enhanced, even
for a simple operation; <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnt-instance</span> <span class="pre">remove</span></tt> on a diskless instance
remove goes from ~9seconds to ~2 seconds</li>
<li>node failure of non-candidates will be less impacting on the cluster</li>
</ul>
<p>The default value for the candidate pool size will be set to 10 but
this can be changed at cluster creation and modified any time later.</p>
<p>Testing on simulated big clusters with sequential and parallel jobs
show that this value (10) is a sweet-spot from performance and load
point of view.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="offline-flag">
<h5><em>offline</em> flag<a class="headerlink" href="#offline-flag" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>In order to support better the situation in which nodes are offline
(e.g. for repair) without altering the cluster configuration, Ganeti
needs to be told and needs to properly handle this state for nodes.</p>
<p>This will result in simpler procedures, and less mistakes, when the
amount of node failures is high on an absolute scale (either due to
high failure rate or simply big clusters).</p>
<p>Nodes having this attribute set will not be contacted for inter-node
RPC calls, will not be master candidates, and will not be able to host
instances as primaries.</p>
<p>Setting this attribute on a node:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>will not be allowed if the node is the master</li>
<li>will not be allowed if the node has primary instances</li>
<li>will cause the node to be demoted from the master candidate role (if
it was), possibly causing another node to be promoted to that role</li>
</ul>
<p>This attribute will impact the cluster operations as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>querying these nodes for anything will fail instantly in the RPC
library, with a specific RPC error (RpcResult.offline == True)</li>
<li>they will be listed in the Other section of cluster verify</li>
</ul>
<p>The code is changed in the following ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>RPC calls were be converted to skip such nodes:<ul>
<li>RpcRunner-instance-based RPC calls are easy to convert</li>
<li>static/classmethod RPC calls are harder to convert, and were left
alone</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the RPC results were unified so that this new result state (offline)
can be differentiated</li>
<li>master voting still queries in repair nodes, as we need to ensure
consistency in case the (wrong) masters have old data, and nodes have
come back from repairs</li>
</ul>
<p>Caveats:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>some operation semantics are less clear (e.g. what to do on instance
start with offline secondary?); for now, these will just fail as if
the flag is not set (but faster)</li>
<li>2-node cluster with one node offline needs manual startup of the
master with a special flag to skip voting (as the master can&#8217;t get a
quorum there)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the advantages of implementing this flag is that it will allow
in the future automation tools to automatically put the node in
repairs and recover from this state, and the code (should/will) handle
this much better than just timing out. So, future possible
improvements (for later versions):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>watcher will detect nodes which fail RPC calls, will attempt to ssh
to them, if failure will put them offline</li>
<li>watcher will try to ssh and query the offline nodes, if successful
will take them off the repair list</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatives considered: The RPC call model in 2.0 is, by default,
much nicer - errors are logged in the background, and job/opcode
execution is clearer, so we could simply not introduce this. However,
having this state will make both the codepaths clearer (offline
vs. temporary failure) and the operational model (it&#8217;s not a node with
errors, but an offline node).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="drained-flag">
<h5><em>drained</em> flag<a class="headerlink" href="#drained-flag" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Due to parallel execution of jobs in Ganeti 2.0, we could have the
following situation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>gnt-node migrate + failover is run</li>
<li>gnt-node evacuate is run, which schedules a long-running 6-opcode
job for the node</li>
<li>partway through, a new job comes in that runs an iallocator script,
which finds the above node as empty and a very good candidate</li>
<li>gnt-node evacuate has finished, but now it has to be run again, to
clean the above instance(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to prevent this situation, and to be able to get nodes into
proper offline status easily, a new <em>drained</em> flag was added to the
nodes.</p>
<p>This flag (which actually means &#8220;is being, or was drained, and is
expected to go offline&#8221;), will prevent allocations on the node, but
otherwise all other operations (start/stop instance, query, etc.) are
working without any restrictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interaction-between-flags">
<h5>Interaction between flags<a class="headerlink" href="#interaction-between-flags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>While these flags are implemented as separate flags, they are
mutually-exclusive and are acting together with the master node role
as a single <em>node status</em> value. In other words, a flag is only in one
of these roles at a given time. The lack of any of these flags denote
a regular node.</p>
<p>The current node status is visible in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnt-cluster</span> <span class="pre">verify</span></tt>
output, and the individual flags can be examined via separate flags in
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnt-node</span> <span class="pre">list</span></tt> output.</p>
<p>These new flags will be exported in both the iallocator input message
and via RAPI, see the respective man pages for the exact names.</p>

<p>The main feature-level changes will be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a number of disk related changes</li>
<li>removal of fixed two-disk, one-nic per instance limitation</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="disk-handling-changes">
<h4>Disk handling changes<a class="headerlink" href="#disk-handling-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The storage options available in Ganeti 1.x were introduced based on
then-current software (first DRBD 0.7 then later DRBD 8) and the
estimated usage patters. However, experience has later shown that some
assumptions made initially are not true and that more flexibility is
needed.</p>
<p>One main assumption made was that disk failures should be treated as
&#8216;rare&#8217; events, and that each of them needs to be manually handled in
order to ensure data safety; however, both these assumptions are false:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>disk failures can be a common occurrence, based on usage patterns or
cluster size</li>
<li>our disk setup is robust enough (referring to DRBD8 + LVM) that we
could automate more of the recovery</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we still don&#8217;t have fully-automated disk recovery as a goal,
but our goal is to reduce the manual work needed.</p>
<p>As such, we plan the following main changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>DRBD8 is much more flexible and stable than its previous version
(0.7), such that removing the support for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">remote_raid1</span></tt>
template and focusing only on DRBD8 is easier</li>
<li>dynamic discovery of DRBD devices is not actually needed in a cluster
that where the DRBD namespace is controlled by Ganeti; switching to a
static assignment (done at either instance creation time or change
secondary time) will change the disk activation time from O(n) to
O(1), which on big clusters is a significant gain</li>
<li>remove the hard dependency on LVM (currently all available storage
types are ultimately backed by LVM volumes) by introducing file-based
storage</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, a number of smaller enhancements are also planned:
- support variable number of disks
- support read-only disks</p>
<p>Future enhancements in the 2.x series, which do not require base design
changes, might include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>enhancement of the LVM allocation method in order to try to keep
all of an instance&#8217;s virtual disks on the same physical
disks</li>
<li>add support for DRBD8 authentication at handshake time in
order to ensure each device connects to the correct peer</li>
<li>remove the restrictions on failover only to the secondary
which creates very strict rules on cluster allocation</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="drbd-minor-allocation">
<h5>DRBD minor allocation<a class="headerlink" href="#drbd-minor-allocation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Currently, when trying to identify or activate a new DRBD (or MD)
device, the code scans all in-use devices in order to see if we find
one that looks similar to our parameters and is already in the desired
state or not. Since this needs external commands to be run, it is very
slow when more than a few devices are already present.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will change the discovery model from dynamic to
static. When a new device is logically created (added to the
configuration) a free minor number is computed from the list of
devices that should exist on that node and assigned to that
device.</p>
<p>At device activation, if the minor is already in use, we check if
it has our parameters; if not so, we just destroy the device (if
possible, otherwise we abort) and start it with our own
parameters.</p>
<p>This means that we in effect take ownership of the minor space for
that device type; if there&#8217;s a user-created DRBD minor, it will be
automatically removed.</p>
<p>The change will have the effect of reducing the number of external
commands run per device from a constant number times the index of the
first free DRBD minor to just a constant number.</p>

<h5>Removal of obsolete device types (MD, DRBD7)<a class="headerlink" href="#removal-of-obsolete-device-types-md-drbd7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>We need to remove these device types because of two issues. First,
DRBD7 has bad failure modes in case of dual failures (both network and
disk - it cannot propagate the error up the device stack and instead
just panics. Second, due to the asymmetry between primary and
secondary in MD+DRBD mode, we cannot do live failover (not even if we
had MD+DRBD8).</p>

<div class="section" id="file-based-storage-support">
<h5>File-based storage support<a class="headerlink" href="#file-based-storage-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>

allow us to get rid of the hard requirement for volume groups for
testing clusters and it would also allow usage of SAN storage to do
live failover taking advantage of this storage solution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="better-lvm-allocation">
<h5>Better LVM allocation<a class="headerlink" href="#better-lvm-allocation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Currently, the LV to PV allocation mechanism is a very simple one: at
each new request for a logical volume, tell LVM to allocate the volume
in order based on the amount of free space. This is good for
simplicity and for keeping the usage equally spread over the available
physical disks, however it introduces a problem that an instance could
end up with its (currently) two drives on two physical disks, or
(worse) that the data and metadata for a DRBD device end up on
different drives.</p>
<p>This is bad because it causes unneeded <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">replace-disks</span></tt> operations in
case of a physical failure.</p>
<p>The solution is to batch allocations for an instance and make the LVM
handling code try to allocate as close as possible all the storage of
one instance. We will still allow the logical volumes to spill over to
additional disks as needed.</p>
<p>Note that this clustered allocation can only be attempted at initial
instance creation, or at change secondary node time. At add disk time,
or at replacing individual disks, it&#8217;s not easy enough to compute the
current disk map so we&#8217;ll not attempt the clustering.</p>

<div class="section" id="failover-to-any-node">
<h5>Failover to any node<a class="headerlink" href="#failover-to-any-node" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>With a modified disk activation sequence, we can implement the
<em>failover to any</em> functionality, removing many of the layout
restrictions of a cluster:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the need to reserve memory on the current secondary: this gets reduced
to a must to reserve memory anywhere on the cluster</li>
<li>the need to first failover and then replace secondary for an
instance: with failover-to-any, we can directly failover to
another node, which also does the replace disks at the same
step</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following, we denote the current primary by P1, the current
secondary by S1, and the new primary and secondaries by P2 and S2. P2
is fixed to the node the user chooses, but the choice of S2 can be
made between P1 and S1. This choice can be constrained, depending on
which of P1 and S1 has failed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>if P1 has failed, then S1 must become S2, and live migration is not
possible</li>
<li>if S1 has failed, then P1 must become S2, and live migration could be
possible (in theory, but this is not a design goal for 2.0)</li>
</ul>
<p>The algorithm for performing the failover is straightforward:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>verify that S2 (the node the user has chosen to keep as secondary) has
valid data (is consistent)</li>
<li>tear down the current DRBD association and setup a DRBD pairing
between P2 (P2 is indicated by the user) and S2; since P2 has no data,
it will start re-syncing from S2</li>
<li>as soon as P2 is in state SyncTarget (i.e. after the resync has
started but before it has finished), we can promote it to primary role
(r/w) and start the instance on P2</li>
<li>as soon as the P2?S2 sync has finished, we can remove
the old data on the old node that has not been chosen for
S2</li>
</ul>
<p>Caveats: during the P2?S2 sync, a (non-transient) network error
will cause I/O errors on the instance, so (if a longer instance
downtime is acceptable) we can postpone the restart of the instance
until the resync is done. However, disk I/O errors on S2 will cause
data loss, since we don&#8217;t have a good copy of the data anymore, so in
this case waiting for the sync to complete is not an option. As such,
it is recommended that this feature is used only in conjunction with
proper disk monitoring.</p>
<p>Live migration note: While failover-to-any is possible for all choices
of S2, migration-to-any is possible only if we keep P1 as S2.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id6">
<h5>Caveats<a class="headerlink" href="#id6" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The dynamic device model, while more complex, has an advantage: it
will not reuse by mistake the DRBD device of another instance, since
it always looks for either our own or a free one.</p>
<p>The static one, in contrast, will assume that given a minor number N,
it&#8217;s ours and we can take over. This needs careful implementation such
that if the minor is in use, either we are able to cleanly shut it
down, or we abort the startup. Otherwise, it could be that we start
syncing between two instance&#8217;s disks, causing data loss.</p>

<h5>Variable number of disks<a class="headerlink" href="#variable-number-of-disks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>In order to support high-security scenarios (for example read-only sda
and read-write sdb), we need to make a fully flexibly disk
definition. This has less impact that it might look at first sight:
only the instance creation has hard coded number of disks, not the disk
handling code. The block device handling and most of the instance
handling code is already working with &#8220;the instance&#8217;s disks&#8221; as
opposed to &#8220;the two disks of the instance&#8221;, but some pieces are not
(e.g. import/export) and the code needs a review to ensure safety.</p>
<p>The objective is to be able to specify the number of disks at
instance creation, and to be able to toggle from read-only to
read-write a disk afterward.</p>

<div class="section" id="variable-number-of-nics">
<h5>Variable number of NICs<a class="headerlink" href="#variable-number-of-nics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Similar to the disk change, we need to allow multiple network
interfaces per instance. This will affect the internal code (some
function will have to stop assuming that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">instance.nics</span></tt> is a list
of length one), the OS API which currently can export/import only one

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Interface changes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#interface-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are two areas of interface changes: API-level changes (the OS
interface and the RAPI interface) and the command line interface
changes.</p>
<div class="section" id="os-interface">
<h4>OS interface<a class="headerlink" href="#os-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The current Ganeti OS interface, version 5, is tailored for Ganeti 1.2.
The interface is composed by a series of scripts which get called with
certain parameters to perform OS-dependent operations on the cluster.
The current scripts are:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>create</dt>
<dd>called when a new instance is added to the cluster</dd>
<dt>export</dt>
<dd>called to export an instance disk to a stream</dd>
<dt>import</dt>
<dd>called to import from a stream to a new instance</dd>
<dt>rename</dt>
<dd>called to perform the os-specific operations necessary for renaming an
instance</dd>
</dl>
<p>Currently these scripts suffer from the limitations of Ganeti 1.2: for
example they accept exactly one block and one swap devices to operate
on, rather than any amount of generic block devices, they blindly assume
that an instance will have just one network interface to operate, they
can not be configured to optimise the instance for a particular
hypervisor.</p>
<p>Since in Ganeti 2.0 we want to support multiple hypervisors, and a
non-fixed number of network and disks the OS interface need to change to
transmit the appropriate amount of information about an instance to its
managing operating system, when operating on it. Moreover since some old
assumptions usually used in OS scripts are no longer valid we need to
re-establish a common knowledge on what can be assumed and what cannot
be regarding Ganeti environment.</p>
<p>When designing the new OS API our priorities are:
- ease of use
- future extensibility
- ease of porting from the old API
- modularity</p>
<p>As such we want to limit the number of scripts that must be written to
support an OS, and make it easy to share code between them by uniforming
their input.  We also will leave the current script structure unchanged,
as far as we can, and make a few of the scripts (import, export and
rename) optional. Most information will be passed to the script through
environment variables, for ease of access and at the same time ease of
using only the information a script needs.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-scripts">
<h5>The Scripts<a class="headerlink" href="#the-scripts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>As in Ganeti 1.2, every OS which wants to be installed in Ganeti needs
to support the following functionality, through scripts:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>create:</dt>
<dd>used to create a new instance running that OS. This script should
prepare the block devices, and install them so that the new OS can
boot under the specified hypervisor.</dd>
<dt>export (optional):</dt>
<dd>used to export an installed instance using the given OS to a format
which can be used to import it back into a new instance.</dd>
<dt>import (optional):</dt>
<dd>used to import an exported instance into a new one. This script is
similar to create, but the new instance should have the content of the
export, rather than contain a pristine installation.</dd>
<dt>rename (optional):</dt>
<dd>used to perform the internal OS-specific operations needed to rename
an instance.</dd>
</dl>
<p>If any optional script is not implemented Ganeti will refuse to perform
the given operation on instances using the non-implementing OS. Of
course the create script is mandatory, and it doesn&#8217;t make sense to
support the either the export or the import operation but not both.</p>

<h6>Incompatibilities with 1.2<a class="headerlink" href="#incompatibilities-with-1-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>We expect the following incompatibilities between the OS scripts for 1.2
and the ones for 2.0:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Input parameters: in 1.2 those were passed on the command line, in 2.0
we&#8217;ll use environment variables, as there will be a lot more
information and not all OSes may care about all of it.</li>
<li>Number of calls: export scripts will be called once for each device
the instance has, and import scripts once for every exported disk.
Imported instances will be forced to have a number of disks greater or
equal to the one of the export.</li>
<li>Some scripts are not compulsory: if such a script is missing the
relevant operations will be forbidden for instances of that OS. This
makes it easier to distinguish between unsupported operations and
no-op ones (if any).</li>

<div class="section" id="input">
<h6>Input<a class="headerlink" href="#input" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>

<p>These are only the basic variables we are thinking of now, but more
may come during the implementation and they will be documented in the
<em>ganeti-os-api</em> man page. All these variables will be
available to all scripts.</p>
<p>Some scripts will need a few more information to work. These will have
per-script variables, such as for example:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>OLD_INSTANCE_NAME</dt>
<dd>rename: the name the instance should be renamed from.</dd>
<dt>EXPORT_DEVICE</dt>
<dd>export: device to be exported, a snapshot of the actual device. The

<dt>EXPORT_INDEX</dt>
<dd>export: sequential number of the instance device targeted.</dd>

<dd>import: device to send the data to, part of the new instance. The data
must be imported from stdin.</dd>
<dt>IMPORT_INDEX</dt>
<dd>import: sequential number of the instance device targeted.</dd>
</dl>
<p>(Rationale for INSTANCE_NAME as an environment variable: the instance
name is always needed and we could pass it on the command line. On the
other hand, though, this would force scripts to both access the
environment and parse the command line, so we&#8217;ll move it for
uniformity.)</p>

<div class="section" id="output-behaviour">
<h6>Output/Behaviour<a class="headerlink" href="#output-behaviour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>As discussed scripts should only send user-targeted information to
stderr. The create and import scripts are supposed to format/initialise
the given block devices and install the correct instance data. The
export script is supposed to export instance data to stdout in a format
understandable by the the import script. The data will be compressed by
Ganeti, so no compression should be done. The rename script should only
modify the instance&#8217;s knowledge of what its name is.</p>

<div class="section" id="other-declarative-style-features">
<h5>Other declarative style features<a class="headerlink" href="#other-declarative-style-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Similar to Ganeti 1.2, OS specifications will need to provide a
&#8216;ganeti_api_version&#8217; containing list of numbers matching the
version(s) of the API they implement. Ganeti itself will always be
compatible with one version of the API and may maintain backwards
compatibility if it&#8217;s feasible to do so. The numbers are one-per-line,
so an OS supporting both version 5 and version 20 will have a file
containing two lines. This is different from Ganeti 1.2, which only
supported one version number.</p>
<p>In addition to that an OS will be able to declare that it does support
only a subset of the Ganeti hypervisors, by declaring them in the
&#8216;hypervisors&#8217; file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="caveats-notes">
<h5>Caveats/Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#caveats-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>We might want to have a &#8220;default&#8221; import/export behaviour that just
dumps all disks and restores them. This can save work as most systems
will just do this, while allowing flexibility for different systems.</p>
<p>Environment variables are limited in size, but we expect that there will
be enough space to store the information we need. If we discover that
this is not the case we may want to go to a more complex API such as
storing those information on the filesystem and providing the OS script
with the path to a file where they are encoded in some format.</p>

<div class="section" id="remote-api-changes">
<h4>Remote API changes<a class="headerlink" href="#remote-api-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The first Ganeti remote API (RAPI) was designed and deployed with the
Ganeti 1.2.5 release.  That version provide read-only access to the
cluster state. Fully functional read-write API demands significant
internal changes which will be implemented in version 2.0.</p>
<p>We decided to go with implementing the Ganeti RAPI in a RESTful way,
which is aligned with key features we looking. It is simple,
stateless, scalable and extensible paradigm of API implementation. As
transport it uses HTTP over SSL, and we are implementing it with JSON
encoding, but in a way it possible to extend and provide any other
one.</p>
<div class="section" id="design">
<h5>Design<a class="headerlink" href="#design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The Ganeti RAPI is implemented as independent daemon, running on the
same node with the same permission level as Ganeti master
daemon. Communication is done through the LUXI library to the master
daemon. In order to keep communication asynchronous RAPI processes two
types of client requests:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>queries: server is able to answer immediately</li>
<li>job submission: some time is required for a useful response</li>
</ul>
<p>In the query case requested data send back to client in the HTTP
response body. Typical examples of queries would be: list of nodes,
instances, cluster info, etc.</p>
<p>In the case of job submission, the client receive a job ID, the
identifier which allows one to query the job progress in the job queue
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#job-queue">Job Queue</a>).</p>
<p>Internally, each exported object has an version identifier, which is
used as a state identifier in the HTTP header E-Tag field for
requests/responses to avoid race conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resource-representation">
<h5>Resource representation<a class="headerlink" href="#resource-representation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The key difference of using REST instead of others API is that REST
requires separation of services via resources with unique URIs. Each
of them should have limited amount of state and support standard HTTP
methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT.</p>
<p>For example in Ganeti&#8217;s case we can have a set of URI:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/{clustername}/instances</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/{clustername}/instances/{instancename}</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/{clustername}/instances/{instancename}/tag</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/{clustername}/tag</span></tt></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>A GET request to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/{clustername}/instances</span></tt> will return the list of
instances, a POST to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/{clustername}/instances</span></tt> should create a new
instance, a DELETE <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/{clustername}/instances/{instancename}</span></tt> should
delete the instance, a GET <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/{clustername}/tag</span></tt> should return get
cluster tags.</p>
<p>Each resource URI will have a version prefix. The resource IDs are to
be determined.</p>
<p>Internal encoding might be JSON, XML, or any other. The JSON encoding
fits nicely in Ganeti RAPI needs. The client can request a specific
representation via the Accept field in the HTTP header.</p>
<p>REST uses HTTP as its transport and application protocol for resource
access. The set of possible responses is a subset of standard HTTP
responses.</p>
<p>The statelessness model provides additional reliability and
transparency to operations (e.g. only one request needs to be analyzed
to understand the in-progress operation, not a sequence of multiple
requests/responses).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id7">
<h5>Security<a class="headerlink" href="#id7" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>With the write functionality security becomes a much bigger an issue.
The Ganeti RAPI uses basic HTTP authentication on top of an
SSL-secured connection to grant access to an exported resource. The
password is stored locally in an Apache-style <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.htpasswd</span></tt> file. Only
one level of privileges is supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id8">
<h5>Caveats<a class="headerlink" href="#id8" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The model detailed above for job submission requires the client to
poll periodically for updates to the job; an alternative would be to
allow the client to request a callback, or a &#8216;wait for updates&#8217; call.</p>
<p>The callback model was not considered due to the following two issues:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>callbacks would require a new model of allowed callback URLs,
together with a method of managing these</li>
<li>callbacks only work when the client and the master are in the same
security domain, and they fail in the other cases (e.g. when there is
a firewall between the client and the RAPI daemon that only allows
client-to-RAPI calls, which is usual in DMZ cases)</li>
</ul>
<p>The &#8216;wait for updates&#8217; method is not suited to the HTTP protocol,
where requests are supposed to be short-lived.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="command-line-changes">
<h4>Command line changes<a class="headerlink" href="#command-line-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Ganeti 2.0 introduces several new features as well as new ways to
handle instance resources like disks or network interfaces. This
requires some noticeable changes in the way command line arguments are
handled.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>extend and modify command line syntax to support new features</li>
<li>ensure consistent patterns in command line arguments to reduce
cognitive load</li>
</ul>
<p>The design changes that require these changes are, in no particular
order:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>flexible instance disk handling: support a variable number of disks
with varying properties per instance,</li>
<li>flexible instance network interface handling: support a variable
number of network interfaces with varying properties per instance</li>
<li>multiple hypervisors: multiple hypervisors can be active on the same
cluster, each supporting different parameters,</li>
<li>support for device type CDROM (via ISO image)</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, there are several areas of Ganeti where the command line
arguments will change:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cluster configuration<ul>
<li>cluster initialization</li>
<li>cluster default configuration</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instance configuration<ul>
<li>handling of network cards for instances,</li>
