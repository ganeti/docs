NAME
----

hroller \- Cluster rolling maintenance scheduler for Ganeti

SYNOPSIS
--------

**hroller** {backend options...} [algorithm options...] [reporting options...]

**hroller** \--version


Backend options:

{ **-m** *cluster* | **-L[** *path* **]** | **-t** *data-file* |
**-I** *path* }

Algorithm options:

**[ -G *name* ]**

**[ -O *name...* ]**

Reporting options:

**[ -v... | -q ]**
**[ -S *file* ]**

DESCRIPTION
-----------

hroller is a cluster maintenance reboot scheduler. It can calculate
which set of nodes can be rebooted at the same time while avoiding
having both primary and secondary nodes being rebooted at the same time.

For backends that support identifying the master node (currenlty
RAPI and LUXI), the master node is scheduled as the last node
in the last reboot group.

ALGORITHM FOR CALCULATING OFFLINE REBOOT GROUPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

hroller will view the nodes as vertices of an undirected graph,
connecting by instances which have both a primary and a secondary node.
It will then color the graph using a few different heuristics, and
return the minimum-size color set found. Node with the same color don't
share an edge, and as such don't have an instance with both primary and
secondary node on them, so they are safe to be rebooted concurrently.

OPTIONS
-------

Currently only standard htools options are supported. For a description of them
check **htools**\(1) and **hbal**\(1).

BUGS
----

Offline nodes should be ignored.

If instances are online the tool should refuse to do offline rolling
maintenances, unless explicitly requested.

End-to-end shelltests should be provided.

Online rolling maintenances (where instance need not be shut down, but
are migrated from node to node) are not supported yet. Hroller by design
should support them both with and without secondary node replacement.

EXAMPLE
-------

Offline Rolling node reboot output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the default options, the program shows one reboot group per line as
a comma-separated list.
