mon-collector
==========================================

NAME
----

mon-collector - Command line interface for the data collectors of the
monitoring system

SYNOPSIS
--------

**mon-collector** {collector}

DESCRIPTION
-----------

``mon-collector`` is a suite of tools designed to provide a command line
interface to the data collectors implemented by the ganeti monitoring system.
``mon-collector`` is also the generic binary that must be invoked specifying,
as the first command line parameter, the name of the actual desired data
collector to be run.

When executed, ``mon-collector`` will run the specified collector and will
print its output to stdout, in JSON format.




COLLECTORS
----------

DRBD
~~~~

| drbd [ [ **-s** | **\--drbd-status** ] = *status-file* ] [ [ **-p** | **\--drbd-pairing**] = *pairing-file* ]

Collects the information about the version and status of the DRBD kernel
module, and of the disks it is managing.

If *status-file* and *pairing-file* are specified, the status and the
instance-minor paring information will be read from those files.
Otherwise, the collector will read them, respectively, from /proc/drbd
and from the Confd server.

The options that can be passed to the DRBD collector are as follows:

-s *status-file*, \--drbd-status=*status-file*
  Read the DRBD status from the specified file instead of /proc/drbd.

-p *pairing-file*, \--drbd-pairing=*pairing-file*
  Read the information about the pairing between instances and DRBD minors
  from the specified file instead of asking the Confd servers for them.
