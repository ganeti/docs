  >DESCRIPTION</h1
  ><p
  >The method of supporting guest operating systems in Ganeti is to have, for each guest OS type, a directory containing a number of required files. This directory must be present across all nodes (Ganeti doesn't replicate it) in order for the OS to be usable by Ganeti.</p
  ></div
><div id="reference"
><h1
  >REFERENCE</h1
  ><p
  >There are six required files: <em
    >create</em

    >, <em
    >export</em
    >, <em
    >rename</em

    >create</h2
    ><p
    >The <strong
      >create</strong
      > command is used for creating a new instance from scratch. It has no additional environment variables bside the common ones.</p
    ><p
    >The <code
      >INSTANCE_NAME</code
      > variable denotes the name of the instance, which is guaranteed to resolve to an IP address. The create script should configure the instance according to this name. It can configure the IP statically or not, depending on the deployment environment.</p
    ><p
    >The <code
      >INSTANCE_REINSTALL</code
      > variable is set to <code
      >1</code
      > when this create request is reinstalling and existing instance, rather than creating one anew. This can be used, for example, to preserve some data in the old instance in an OS-specific way.</p
    ></div
  ><div id="export"
  ><h2
    >export</h2
    ><p
    >This command is used in order to make a backup of a given disk of the instance. The command should write to stdout a dump of the given block device. The output of this program will be passed during restore to the <strong
      >import</strong
      > command.</p
    ><p
    >The specific disk to backup is denoted by two additional environment variables: <code
      >EXPORT_INDEX</code
      > which denotes the index in the instance disks structure (and could be used for example to skip the second disk if not needed for backup) and <code
      >EXPORT_PATH</code
      > which has the same value as <code
      >DISK_N_PATH</code
      > but is duplicate here for easier usage by shell scripts (rather than parse the <code
      >DISK_...</code
      > variables).</p
    ><p
    >To provide the user with an estimate on how long the export will take, a predicted size can be written to the file descriptor passed in the variable <code
      >EXP_SIZE_FD</code
      >. The value is in bytes and must be terminated by a newline character (<code
      >\n</code
      >). Older versions of Ganeti don't support this feature, hence the variable should be checked before use. Example:</p
    ><pre
    ><code
      >if test -n &quot;$EXP_SIZE_FD&quot;; then
  blockdev --getsize64 $blockdev &gt;&amp;$EXP_SIZE_FD
fi
</code
      ></pre

  ><div id="import"
  ><h2
    >import</h2
    ><p
    >The <strong
      >import</strong
      > command is used for restoring an instance from a backup as done by <strong
      >export</strong
      >. The arguments are the similar to those passed to <strong
      >export</strong
      >, whose output will be provided on stdin.</p
    ><p
    >The difference in variables is that the current disk is called by <code
      >IMPORT_DEVICE</code
      > and <code
      >IMPORT_INDEX</code
      > (instead of <code
      >EXPORT_...</code
      >).</p
    ></div
  ><div id="rename"
  ><h2
    >rename</h2
    ><p
    >This command is used in order to perform a rename at the instance OS level, after the instance has been renamed in Ganeti. The command should do whatever steps are required to ensure that the instance is updated to use the new name, if the operating system supports it.</p
    ><p
    >Note that it is acceptable for the rename script to do nothing at all, however be warned that in this case, there will be a desynchronization between what gnt-instance list shows you and the actual hostname of the instance.</p
    ><p
    >The script will be passed one additional environment variable called <code
      >OLD_INSTANCE_NAME</code
      > which holds the old instance name. The <code
      >INSTANCE_NAME</code
      > variable holds the new instance name.</p
    ><p
    >A very simple rename script should at least change the hostname and IP address of the instance, leaving the administrator to update the other services.</p

  ><div id="verify"
  ><h2
    >verify</h2
    ><p
    >The <em
      >verify</em
      > script is used to verify consistency of the OS parameters (see below). The command should take one or more arguments denoting what checks should be performed, and return a proper exit code depending on whether the validation failed or succeeded.</p
    ><p
    >Currently (API version 20), only one parameter is supported: <code
      >parameters</code
      >. This should validate the <code
      >OSP_</code
      > variables from the environment, and output diagnostic message in case the validation fails.</p
    ><p
    >For the <code
      >dhcp</code
      > parameter given as example above, a verification script could be:</p
    ><pre
    ><code
