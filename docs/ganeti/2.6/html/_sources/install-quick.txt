Ganeti quick installation guide
===============================

Please note that a more detailed installation procedure is described in
the :doc:`install`. A glossary of terms can be found in the
:doc:`glossary`.


Software Requirements

  versions 0.11.X and above have shown good behavior).

  <socat-note>` below
- `Paramiko <http://www.lag.net/paramiko/>`_, if you want automated SSH

- `fping <http://fping.sourceforge.net/>`_

These programs are supplied as part of most Linux distributions, so
usually they can be installed via the standard package manager. Also
many of them will already be installed on a standard machine. On
Debian/Ubuntu, you can use this command line to install all required
packages, except for RBD, DRBD and Xen::

  $ apt-get install lvm2 ssh bridge-utils iproute iputils-arping \
                    ndisc6 python python-pyopenssl openssl \
                    python-pyparsing python-simplejson \
                    python-pyinotify python-pycurl socat \
                    python-elementtree qemu

On Fedora to install all required packages except RBD, DRBD and Xen::

  $ yum install openssh openssh-clients bridge-utils iproute ndisc6 \
                pyOpenSSL pyparsing python-simplejson python-inotify \
                python-lxml python-paramiko socat qemu-img


If you want to build from source, please see doc/devnotes.rst for more
dependencies.

.. _socat-note:
.. note::
  Ganeti's import/export functionality uses ``socat`` with OpenSSL for
  transferring data between nodes. By default, OpenSSL 0.9.8 and above
  employ transparent compression of all data using zlib if supported by
  both sides of a connection. In cases where a lot of data is
  transferred, this can lead to an increased CPU usage. Additionally,
  Ganeti already compresses all data using ``gzip`` where it makes sense
  (for inter-cluster instance moves).

  To remedey this situation, patches implementing a new ``socat`` option
  for disabling OpenSSL compression have been contributed and will
  likely be included in the next feature release. Until then, users or
  distributions need to apply the patches on their own.

  Ganeti will use the option if it's detected by the ``configure``
  script; auto-detection can be disabled by explicitly passing
  ``--enable-socat-compress`` (use the option to disable compression) or
  ``--disable-socat-compress`` (don't use the option).

  The patches and more information can be found on
  http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/contrib/socat-opensslcompress.html.

Haskell requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to enable the `htools` component, which is recommended on
bigger deployments (this give you automatic instance placement, cluster
balancing, etc.), then you need to have a Haskell compiler installed on
your build machine (but this is not required on the machines which are
just going to run Ganeti). More specifically:

- `GHC <http://www.haskell.org/ghc/>`_ version 6.12 or higher
- or even better, `The Haskell Platform
  <http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/>`_ which gives you a simple way
  to bootstrap Haskell
- `json <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/json>`_, a JSON library
- `network <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/network>`_, a basic
  network library
- `parallel <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parallel>`_, a parallel
  programming library (note: tested with up to version 3.x)
- `curl <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/curl>`_, bindings for the
  curl library, only needed if you want these tools to connect to remote
  clusters (as opposed to the local one)

All of these are also available as package in Debian/Ubuntu::

  $ apt-get install ghc6 libghc6-json-dev libghc6-network-dev \
                    libghc6-parallel-dev libghc6-curl-dev

Or in Fedora running::

  $ yum install ghc ghc-json-devel ghc-network-devel ghc-parallel-devel

The most recent Fedora doesn't provide ``ghc-curl``. So this needs to be
installed using ``cabal`` or alternatively htools can be build without
curl support.

Note that more recent version have switched to GHC 7.x and the packages
were renamed::

  $ apt-get install ghc libghc-json-dev libghc-network-dev \
                    libghc-parallel-dev libghc-curl-dev

If using a distribution which does not provide them, the first install
the Haskell platform and then install the additional libraries via
``cabal``::

  $ cabal install json network parallel curl

The compilation of the htools components is automatically enabled when
the compiler and the requisite libraries are found. You can use the
``--enable-htools`` configure flag to force the selection (at which
point ``./configure`` will fail if it doesn't find the prerequisites).

In Ganeti version 2.6, one of the daemons (``ganeti-confd``) is shipped
in two versions: the Python default version (which has no extra
dependencies), and an experimental Haskell version. This latter version
can be enabled via the ``./configure`` flag ``--enable-confd=haskell``
and a few has extra dependencies:

- `hslogger <http://software.complete.org/hslogger>`_, version 1.1 and
  above (note that Debian Squeeze only has version 1.0.9)
- `Crypto <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Crypto>`_, tested with
  version 4.2.4
- `text <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/text>`_
- ``bytestring``, which usually comes with the compiler
- `hinotify <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hinotify>`_

These libraries are available in Debian Wheezy (but not in Squeeze), so
you can use either apt::

  $ apt-get install libghc-hslogger-dev libghc-crypto-dev libghc-text-dev \
                    libghc-hinotify-dev

or ``cabal``::

  $ cabal install hslogger Crypto text hinotify

to install them.

Installation of the software
----------------------------

To install, simply run the following command::

  $ ./configure --localstatedir=/var --sysconfdir=/etc && \
    make && \
    make install

This will install the software under ``/usr/local``. You then need to
copy ``doc/examples/ganeti.initd`` to ``/etc/init.d/ganeti`` and
integrate it into your boot sequence (``chkconfig``, ``update-rc.d``,
etc.).


Cluster initialisation
----------------------

Before initialising the cluster, on each node you need to create the
following directories:

- ``/etc/ganeti``
- ``/var/lib/ganeti``
- ``/var/log/ganeti``
- ``/srv/ganeti``
- ``/srv/ganeti/os``
- ``/srv/ganeti/export``

After this, use ``gnt-cluster init``.
