Version 2.0.6
  - Fix cleaner behaviour on nodes not in a cluster (Debian bug 568105)
  - Fix a string formatting bug
  - Improve safety of the code in some error paths
  - Improve data validation in the master of values returned from nodes

Version 2.0.5
  - Fix security issue due to missing validation of iallocator names;
    this allows local and remote execution of arbitrary executables
  - Fix failure of gnt-node list during instance removal
  - Ship the RAPI documentation in the archive

Version 2.0.4
  - Fixed many wrong messages
  - Fixed a few bugs related to the locking library
  - Fixed MAC checking at instance creation time
  - Fixed a DRBD parsing bug related to gaps in /proc/drbd
  - Fixed a few issues related to signal handling in both daemons and
    scripts
  - Fixed the example startup script provided
  - Fixed insserv dependencies in the example startup script (patch from
    Debian)
  - Fixed handling of drained nodes in the iallocator framework
  - Fixed handling of KERNEL_PATH parameter for xen-hvm (Debian bug
    #528618)
  - Fixed error related to invalid job IDs in job polling
  - Fixed job/opcode persistence on unclean master shutdown
  - Fixed handling of partial job processing after unclean master
    shutdown
  - Fixed error reporting from LUs, previously all errors were converted
    into execution errors
  - Fixed error reporting from burnin
  - Decreased significantly the memory usage of the job queue
  - Optimised slightly multi-job submission
  - Optimised slightly opcode loading
  - Backported the multi-job submit framework from the development
    branch; multi-instance start and stop should be faster
  - Added script to clean archived jobs after 21 days; this will reduce
    the size of the queue directory
  - Added some extra checks in disk size tracking
  - Added an example ethers hook script
  - Added a cluster parameter that prevents Ganeti from modifying of
    /etc/hosts
  - Added more node information to RAPI responses
  - Added a “gnt-job watch” command that allows following the ouput of a
    job
  - Added a bind-address option to ganeti-rapi
  - Added more checks to the configuration verify
  - Enhanced the burnin script such that some operations can be retried
    automatically
  - Converted instance reinstall to multi-instance model

Version 2.0.3
  - Added “--ignore-size” to the “gnt-instance activate-disks” command
    to allow using the pre-2.0.2 behaviour in activation, if any
    existing instances have mismatched disk sizes in the configuration
  - Added “gnt-cluster repair-disk-sizes” command to check and update
    any configuration mismatches for disk sizes
  - Added “gnt-master cluste-failover --no-voting” to allow master
    failover to work on two-node clusters
  - Fixed the ‘--net’ option of “gnt-backup import”, which was unusable
  - Fixed detection of OS script errors in “gnt-backup export”
  - Fixed exit code of “gnt-backup export”

Version 2.0.2
  - Added experimental support for stripped logical volumes; this should
    enhance performance but comes with a higher complexity in the block
    device handling; stripping is only enabled when passing
    --with-lvm-stripecount=N to configure, but codepaths are affected
    even in the non-stripped mode
  - Improved resiliency against transient failures at the end of DRBD
    resyncs, and in general of DRBD resync checks
  - Fixed a couple of issues with exports and snapshot errors
  - Fixed a couple of issues in instance listing
  - Added display of the disk size in “gnt-instance info”
  - Fixed checking for valid OSes in instance creation
  - Fixed handling of the ‘vcpus’ parameter in instance listing and in
    general of invalid parameters
  - Fixed http server library, and thus RAPI, to handle invalid
    username/password combinations correctly; this means that now they
    report unauthorized for queries too, not only for modifications,
    allowing earlier detect of configuration problems
  - Added a new ‘role’ node list field, equivalent to the master/master
    candidate/drained/offline flags combinations
  - Fixed cluster modify and changes of candidate pool size
  - Fixed cluster verify error messages for wrong files on regular nodes
  - Fixed a couple of issues with node demotion from master candidate
    role
  - Fixed node readd issues
  - Added non-interactive mode for “ganeti-masterd --no-voting” startup
  - Added a new ‘--no-voting’ option for masterfailover to fix failover
    on two-nodes clusters when the former master node is unreachable
  - Added instance reinstall over RAPI

Version 2.0.1
  - added -H/-B startup parameters to gnt-instance, which will allow
    re-adding the start in single-user option (regression from 1.2)
  - the watcher writes the instance status to a file, to allow
    monitoring to report the instance status (from the master) based on
    cached results of the watcher's queries; while this can get stale if
    the watcher is being locked due to other work on the cluster, this
    is still an improvement
  - the watcher now also restarts the node daemon and the rapi daemon if
    they died
  - fixed the watcher to handle full and drained queue cases
  - hooks export more instance data in the environment, which helps if
    hook scripts need to take action based on the instance's properties
    (no longer need to query back into ganeti)
  - instance failovers when the instance is stopped do not check for
    free RAM, so that failing over a stopped instance is possible in low
    memory situations
  - rapi uses queries for tags instead of jobs (for less job traffic),
    and for cluster tags it won't talk to masterd at all but read them
    from ssconf
  - a couple of error handling fixes in RAPI
  - drbd handling: improved the error handling of inconsistent disks
    after resync to reduce the frequency of "there are some degraded
    disks for this instance" message
  - fixed a bug in live migration when DRBD doesn't want to reconnect
    (the error handling path called a wrong function name)

Version 2.0.0 final
  - no changes from rc5

Version 2.0 release candidate 5
  - fix a couple of bugs (validation, argument checks)
  - fix gnt-cluster getmaster on non-master nodes (regression)
  - some small improvements to RAPI and IAllocator
  - make watcher automatically start the master daemon if down

Version 2.0 release candidate 4
  - change the OS list to not require locks; this helps with big
    clusters
  - fix gnt-cluster verify and gnt-cluster verify-disks when the volume
    group is broken
  - “gnt-instance info”, without any arguments, doesn't run for all
    instances anymore; either pass ‘--all’ or pass the desired
    instances; this helps against mistakes on big clusters where listing
    the information for all instances takes a long time
  - miscellaneous doc and man pages fixes

Version 2.0 release candidate 3
  - Change the internal locking model of some gnt-node commands, in
    order to reduce contention (and blocking of master daemon) when
    batching many creation/reinstall jobs
  - Fixes to Xen soft reboot
  - No longer build documentation at 'make' time, instead distribute it
    in the archive, in order to reduce the need for the whole
    docbook/rst toolchains

Version 2.0 release candidate 2
  - Now the cfgupgrade scripts works and can upgrade 1.2.7 clusters to
    2.0
  - Fix watcher startup sequence, improves the behaviour of busy
    clusters
  - Some other fixes in cluster verify, replace-disks, gnt-instance add,
    gnt-cluster queue, KVM VNC bind address and other places
  - Some documentation fixes and updates

Version 2.0 release candidate 1
  - More documentation updates, now all docs should be more-or-less
    up-to-date
  - A couple of small fixes (mixed hypervisor clusters, offline nodes,
    etc.)
  - Added a customizable HV_KERNEL_ARGS hypervisor parameter (for Xen
    PVM and KVM)
  - Fix an issue related to $libdir/run/ganeti and cluster creation

Version 2.0 beta 2
  - Xen PVM and KVM have switched the default value for the instance
    root disk to the first partition on the first drive, instead of the
    whole drive; this means that the OS installation scripts must be
    changed accordingly
  - Man pages have been updated
  - RAPI has been switched by default to HTTPS, and the exported
    functions should all work correctly
  - RAPI v1 has been removed
  - Many improvements to the KVM hypervisor
  - Block device errors are now better reported
  - Many other bugfixes and small improvements

Version 2.0 beta 1
  - Version 2 is a general rewrite of the code and therefore the
    differences are too many to list, see the design document for 2.0 in
    the doc/ subdirectory for more details
  - In this beta version there is not yet a migration path from 1.2
    (there will be one in the final 2.0 release)
  - A few significant changes are:
    - all commands are executed by a daemon (ganeti-masterd) and the
      various gnt-* commands are just front-ends to it
    - all the commands are entered into, and executed from a job queue,
      see gnt-job(8)
    - the RAPI daemon supports read-write operations, secured by basic
      HTTP authentication on top of HTTPS
    - DRBD version 0.7 support has been removed, DRBD 8 is the only
      supported version (when migrating from Ganeti 1.2 to 2.0, you need
      to migrate to DRBD 8 first while still running Ganeti 1.2)
    - DRBD devices are using statically allocated minor numbers, which
      will be assigned to existing instances during the migration
      process
    - there is support for both Xen PVM and Xen HVM instances running on
      the same cluster
    - KVM virtualization is supported too
    - file-based storage has been implemented, which means that it is
      possible to run the cluster without LVM and DRBD storage, for
      example using a shared filesystem exported from shared storage
      (and still have live migration)

Version 1.2.7
  - Change the default reboot type in gnt-instance reboot to "hard"
  - Reuse the old instance mac address by default on instance import,
    if the instance name is the same.
  - Handle situations in which the node info rpc returns incomplete results
    (issue 46)
  - Add checks for tcp/udp ports collisions in gnt-cluster verify
  - Improved version of batcher:
    - state file support
    - instance mac address support
    - support for HVM clusters/instances
  - Add an option to show the number of cpu sockets and nodes in gnt-node list
  - Support OSes that handle more than one version of the OS api
    (but do not change the current API in any other way)
  - Fix gnt-node migrate
  - gnt-debug man page
  - Fixes various more typos&small issues
  - Increase disk resync maximum speed to 60MB/s (from 30MB/s)

Version 1.2.6
  - new --hvm-nic-type and --hvm-disk-type flags to control the type of disk
    exported to fully virtualized instances.
  - provide access to the serial console of HVM instances
  - instance auto_balance flag, set by default. If turned off it will avoid
    warnings on cluster verify if there is not enough memory to fail over an
    instance. in the future it will prevent automatically failing it over when
    we will support that.
  - batcher tool for instance creation, see /tools/README.batcher
  - gnt-instance reinstall --select-os to interactively select a new operating
    system when reinstalling an instance.
  - when changing the memory amount on instance modify a check has been added
    that the instance will be able to start. also warnings are emitted if the
    instance will not be able to fail over, if auto_balance is true.
  - documentation fixes
  - sync fields between instance list/modify/add/import
  - fix a race condition in drbd when the sync speed was set after giving the
    device a remote peer.

Version 1.2.5
  - note: the allowed size and number of tags per object were reduced
  - fix a bug in “gnt-cluster verify” with inconsistent volume groups
  - fixed twisted 8.x compatibility
  - fixed gnt-instance replace-disks with iallocator
  - add TCP keepalives on twisted connections to detect restarted nodes
  - disk increase support, see “gnt-instance grow-disk”
  - implement bulk node/instance query for RAPI
  - add tags in node/instance listing (optional)
  - experimental migration (and live migration) support, read the man
    page for “gnt-instance migrate”
  - the ganeti-watcher logs are now timestamped, and the watcher also
    has some small improvements in handling its state file

Version 1.2.4
  - Experimental readonly, REST-based remote API implementation; automatically
    started on master node, TCP port 5080, if enabled by --enable-rapi
    parameter to configure script.
  - Instance allocator support. Add and import instance accept a --iallocator
    parameter, and call that instance allocator to decide which node to use for
    the instance. The iallocator document describes what's expected from an
    allocator script.
  - gnt-cluster verify N+1 memory redundancy checks: Unless passed the
    --no-nplus1-mem option gnt-cluster verify now checks that if a node is lost
    there is still enough memory to fail over the instances that reside on it.
  - gnt-cluster verify hooks: it is now possible to add post-hooks to
    gnt-cluster verify, to check for site-specific compliance. All the hooks
    will run, and their output, if any, will be displayed. Any failing hook
    will make the verification return an error value.
  - gnt-cluster verify now checks that its peers are reachable on the primary
    and secondary interfaces
  - gnt-node add now supports the --readd option, to readd a node that is still
    declared as part of the cluster and has failed.
  - gnt-* list commands now accept a new -o +field way of specifying output
    fields, that just adds the chosen fields to the default ones.
  - gnt-backup now has a new "remove" command to delete an existing export from
    the filesystem.
  - New per-instance parameters hvm_acpi, hvm_pae and hvm_cdrom_image_path have
    been added. Using them you can enable/disable acpi and pae support, and
    specify a path for a cd image to be exported to the instance. These
    parameters as the name suggest only work on HVM clusters.
  - When upgrading an HVM cluster to Ganeti 1.2.4, the values for ACPI and PAE
    support will be set to the previously hardcoded values, but the (previously
    hardcoded) path to the CDROM ISO image will be unset and if required, needs
    to be set manually with gnt-instance modify after the upgrade..
  - The address to which an instance's VNC console is bound is now selectable
    per-instance, rather than being cluster wide. Of course this only applies
    to instances controlled via VNC, so currently just applies to HVM clusters.

Version 1.2.3
  - more tweaks to the disk activation code (especially helpful for DRBD)
  - change the default ‘gnt-instance list’ output format, now there is
    one combined status field (see the manpage for the exact values this
    field will have)
  - some more fixes for the mac export to hooks change
  - make Ganeti not break with DRBD 8.2.x (which changed the version
    format in /proc/drbd) (issue 24)
  - add an upgrade tool from ‘remote_raid1’ disk template to ‘drbd’ disk
    template, allowing migration from DRBD0.7+MD to DRBD8

Version 1.2.2
  - fix ‘gnt-instance modify’ breakage introduced in 1.2.1 with the HVM
    support (issue 23)
  - add command aliases infrastructure and a few aliases
  - allow listing of VCPUs in the gnt-instance list and improve the man
    pages and the --help option of gnt-node/gnt-instance list
  - fix gnt-backup list with down nodes (issue 21)
  - change the tools location (move from $pkgdatadir to
    $pkglibdir/tools)
  - fix the dist archive and add a check for including svn/git files in
    the future
  - some developer-related changes: improve the burnin and the QA
    suite, add an upload script for testing during development

Version 1.2.1
  - experimental HVM support, read the install document, section
    "Initializing the cluster"
  - allow for the PVM hypervisor per-instance kernel and initrd paths
  - add a new command ‘gnt-cluster verify-disks’ which uses a new
    algorithm to improve the reconnection of the DRBD pairs if the
    device on the secondary node has gone away
  - make logical volume code auto-activate LVs at disk activation time
  - slightly improve the speed of activating disks
  - allow specification of the MAC address at instance creation time,
    and changing it later via ‘gnt-instance modify’
  - fix handling of external commands that generate lots of output on
    stderr
  - update documentation with regard to minimum version of DRBD8
    supported

Version 1.2.0
  - Log the ‘xm create’ output to the node daemon log on failure (to
    help diagnosing the error)
  - In debug mode, log all external commands output if failed to the
    logs
  - Change parsing of lvm commands to ignore stderr

Version 1.2b3
  - Another round of updates to the DRBD 8 code to deal with more
    failures in the replace secondary node operation
  - Some more logging of failures in disk operations (lvm, drbd)
  - A few documentation updates
  - QA updates

Version 1.2b2
  - Change configuration file format from Python's Pickle to JSON.
    Upgrading is possible using the cfgupgrade utility.
  - Add support for DRBD 8.0 (new disk template `drbd`) which allows for
    faster replace disks and is more stable (DRBD 8 has many
    improvements compared to DRBD 0.7)
  - Added command line tags support (see man pages for gnt-instance,
    gnt-node, gnt-cluster)
  - Added instance rename support
  - Added multi-instance startup/shutdown
  - Added cluster rename support
  - Added `gnt-node evacuate` to simplify some node operations
  - Added instance reboot operation that can speedup reboot as compared
    to stop and start
  - Soften the requirement that hostnames are in FQDN format
  - The ganeti-watcher now activates drbd pairs after secondary node
    reboots
  - Removed dependency on debian's patched fping that uses the
    non-standard -S option
  - Now the OS definitions are searched for in multiple, configurable
    paths (easier for distros to package)
  - Some changes to the hooks infrastructure (especially the new
    post-configuration update hook)
  - Other small bugfixes
