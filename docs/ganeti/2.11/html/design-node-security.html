<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Objective</a><a class="headerlink" href="#objective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Up till 2.10, Ganeti distributes security-relevant keys to all nodes,
including nodes that are neither master nor master-candidates. Those
keys are the private and public SSH keys for node communication and the
SSL certficate and private key for RPC communication. Objective of this
design is to limit the set of nodes that can establish ssh and RPC
connections to the master and master candidates.</p>
<p>As pointed out in
<a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/ganeti/issues/detail?id=377">issue 377</a>, this
is a security risk. Since all nodes have these keys, compromising
any of those nodes would possibly give an attacker access to all other
machines in the cluster. Reducing the set of nodes that are able to
make ssh and RPC connections to the master and master candidates would
significantly reduce the risk simply because fewer machines would be a
valuable target for attackers.</p>
<p>Note: For bigger installations of Ganeti, it is advisable to run master
candidate nodes as non-vm-capable nodes. This would reduce the attack
surface for the hypervisor exploitation.</p>

<div class="section" id="current-state-and-shortcomings">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Current state and shortcomings</a><a class="headerlink" href="#current-state-and-shortcomings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Currently (as of 2.10), all nodes hold the following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the ssh host keys (public and private)</li>
<li>the ssh root keys (public and private)</li>
<li>node daemon certificate (the SSL client certificate and its
corresponding private key)</li>
</ul>
<p>Concerning ssh, this setup contains the following security issue. Since
all nodes of a cluster can ssh as root into any other cluster node, one
compromised node can harm all other nodes of a cluster.</p>
<p>Regarding the SSL encryption of the RPC communication with the node
daemon, we currently have the following setup. There is only one
certificate which is used as both, client and server certificate. Besides
the SSL client verification, we check if the used client certificate is
the same as the certificate stored on the server.</p>
<p>This means that any node running a node daemon can also act as an RPC
client and use it to issue RPC calls to other cluster nodes. This in
turn means that any compromised node could be used to make RPC calls to
any node (including itself) to gain full control over VMs. This could
be used by an attacker to for example bring down the VMs or exploit bugs
in the virtualization stacks to gain access to the host machines as well.</p>

<div class="section" id="proposal-concerning-ssh-key-distribution">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Proposal concerning SSH key distribution</a><a class="headerlink" href="#proposal-concerning-ssh-key-distribution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We propose two improvements regarding the ssh keys:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Limit the distribution of the private ssh key to the master candidates.</li>
<li>Use different ssh key pairs for each master candidate.</li>
</ol>
<p>We propose to limit the set of nodes holding the private root user SSH key
to the master and the master candidates. This way, the security risk would
be limited to a rather small set of nodes even though the cluster could
consists of a lot more nodes. The set of master candidates could be protected
better than the normal nodes (for example residing in a DMZ) to enhance
security even more if the administrator wishes so. The following
sections describe in detail which Ganeti commands are affected by this
change and in what way.</p>
<p>Security will be even more increased if each master candidate gets
its own ssh private/public key pair. This way, one can remove a
compromised master candidate from a cluster (including removing it&#8217;s
public key from all nodes&#8217; <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">authorized_keys</span></tt> file) without having to
regenerate and distribute new ssh keys for all master candidates. (Even
though it is be good practice to do that anyway, since the compromising
of the other master candidates might have taken place already.) However,
this improvement was not part of the original feature request and
increases the complexity of node management even more. We therefore
consider it as second step in this design and will address
this after the other parts of this design are implemented.</p>
<p>The following sections describe in detail which Ganeti commands are affected
by the first part of ssh-related improvements, limiting the key
distribution to master candidates only.</p>
<div class="section" id="re-adding-nodes-to-a-cluster">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">(Re-)Adding nodes to a cluster</a><a class="headerlink" href="#re-adding-nodes-to-a-cluster" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>According to <a class="reference internal" href="design-node-add.html"><em>Design for adding a node to a cluster</em></a>, Ganeti transfers the ssh keys to
every node that gets added to the cluster.</p>
<p>We propose to change this procedure to treat master candidates and normal
nodes differently. For master candidates, the procedure would stay as is.
For normal nodes, Ganeti would transfer the public and private ssh host
keys (as before) and only the public root key.</p>
<p>A normal node would not be able to connect via ssh to other nodes, but
the master (and potentially master candidates) can connect to this node.</p>
<p>In case of readding a node that used to be in the cluster before,
handling of the ssh keys would basically be the same with the following
additional modifications: if the node used to be a master or
master-candidate node, but will be a normal node after readding, Ganeti
should make sure that the private root key is deleted if it is still
present on the node.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pro-and-demoting-a-node-to-from-master-candidate">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Pro- and demoting a node to/from master candidate</a><a class="headerlink" href="#pro-and-demoting-a-node-to-from-master-candidate" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If the role of a node is changed from &#8216;normal&#8217; to &#8216;master_candidate&#8217;, the
master node should at that point copy the private root ssh key. When demoting
a node from master candidate to a normal node, the key that have been copied
there on promotion or addition should be removed again.</p>
<p>This affected the behavior of the following commands:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>::</dt>
<dd>gnt-node modify &#8211;master-candidate=yes
gnt-node modify &#8211;master-candidate=no [&#8211;auto-promote]</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the node has been master candidate already before the command to promote
it was issued, Ganeti does not do anything.</p>
<p>Note that when you demote a node from master candidate to normal node, another
master-capable and normal node will be promoted to master candidate. For this
newly promoted node, the same changes apply as if it was explicitely promoted.</p>
<p>The same behavior should be ensured for the corresponding rapi command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="offlining-and-onlining-a-node">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Offlining and onlining a node</a><a class="headerlink" href="#offlining-and-onlining-a-node" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When offlining a node, it immediately loses its role as master or master
candidate as well. When it is onlined again, it will become master
candidate again if it was so before. The handling of the keys should be done
in the same way as when the node is explicitely promoted or demoted to or from
master candidate. See the previous section for details.</p>
<p>This affects the command:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>::</dt>
<dd>gnt-node modify &#8211;offline=yes
gnt-node modify &#8211;offline=no [&#8211;auto-promote]</dd>
</dl>
<p>For offlining, the removal of the keys is particularly important, as the
detection of a compromised node might be the very reason for the offlining.
Of course we cannot guarantee that removal of the key is always successful,
because the node might not be reachable anymore. Even though it is a
best-effort operation, it is still an improvement over the status quo,
because currently Ganeti does not even try to remove any keys.</p>
<p>The same behavior should be ensured for the corresponding rapi command.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cluster-verify">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Cluster verify</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cluster-verify" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>To make sure the private root ssh key was not distributed to a normal
node, &#8216;gnt-cluster verify&#8217; will be extended by a check for the key
on normal nodes. Additionally, it will check if the private key is
indeed present on master candidates.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposal-regarding-node-daemon-certificates">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Proposal regarding node daemon certificates</a><a class="headerlink" href="#proposal-regarding-node-daemon-certificates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the node daemon certificates, we propose the following changes
in the design.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Instead of using the same certificate for all nodes as both, server
and client certificate, we generate a common server certificate (and
the corresponding private key) for all nodes and a different client
certificate (and the corresponding private key) for each node. All
those certificates will be self-signed for now. The client
certificates will use the node UUID as serial number to ensure
uniqueness within the cluster.</li>
<li>In addition, we store a mapping of
(node UUID, client certificate digest) in the cluster&#8217;s configuration
and ssconf for hosts that are master or master candidate.
The client certificate digest is a hash of the client certificate.
We suggest a &#8216;sha1&#8217; hash here. We will call this mapping &#8216;candidate map&#8217;
from here on.</li>
<li>The node daemon will be modified in a way that on an incoming RPC
request, it first performs a client verification (same as before) to
ensure that the requesting host is indeed the holder of the
corresponding private key. Additionally, it compares the digest of
the certificate of the incoming request to the respective entry of
the candidate map. If the digest does not match the entry of the host
in the mapping or is not included in the mapping at all, the SSL
connection is refused.</li>
</ul>
<p>This design has the following advantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A compromised normal node cannot issue RPC calls, because it will
not be in the candidate map. (See the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Drawbacks</span></tt> section regarding
an indirect way of achieving this though.)</li>
<li>A compromised master candidate would be able to issue RPC requests,
but on detection of its compromised state, it can be removed from the
cluster (and thus from the candidate map) without the need for
redistribution of any certificates, because the other master candidates
can continue using their own certificates. However, it is best
practice to issue a complete key renewal even in this case, unless one
can ensure no actions compromising other nodes have not already been
carried out.</li>
<li>A compromised node would not be able to use the other (possibly master
candidate) nodes&#8217; information from the candidate map to issue RPCs,
because the config just stores the digests and not the certificate
itself.</li>
<li>A compromised node would be able to obtain another node&#8217;s certificate
by waiting for incoming RPCs from this other node. However, the node
cannot use the certificate to issue RPC calls, because the SSL client
verification would require the node to hold the corresponding private
key as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Drawbacks of this design:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Complexity of node and certificate management will be increased (see
following sections for details).</li>
<li>If the candidate map is not distributed fast enough to all nodes after
an update of the configuration, it might be possible to issue RPC calls
from a compromised master candidate node that has been removed
from the Ganeti cluster already. However, this is still a better
situation than before and an inherent problem when one wants to
distinguish between master candidates and normal nodes.</li>
<li>A compromised master candidate would still be able to issue RPC calls,
if it uses ssh to retrieve another master candidate&#8217;s client
certificate and the corresponding private SSL key. This is an issue
even with the first part of the improved handling of ssh keys in this
design (limiting ssh keys to master candidates), but it will be
eliminated with the second part of the design (separate ssh keys for
each master candidate).</li>
<li>Even though this proposal is an improvement towards the previous
situation in Ganeti, it still does not use the full power of SSL. For
further improvements, see Section &#8220;Related and future work&#8221;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternative proposals:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Instead of generating a client certificate per node, one could think
of just generating two different client certificates, one for normal
nodes and one for master candidates. Noded could then just check if
the requesting node has the master candidate certificate. Drawback of
this proposal is that once one master candidate gets compromised, all
master candidates would need to get a new certificate even if the
compromised master candidate had not yet fetched the certificates
from the other master candidates via ssh.</li>
<li>In addition to our main proposal, one could think of including a
piece of data (for example the node&#8217;s host name or UUID) in the RPC
call which is encrypted with the requesting node&#8217;s private key. The
node daemon could check if the datum can be decrypted using the node&#8217;s
certificate. However, this would ensure similar functionality as
SSL&#8217;s built-in client verification and add significant complexity
to Ganeti&#8217;s RPC protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following sections, we describe how our design affects various
Ganeti operations.</p>
<div class="section" id="cluster-initialization">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Cluster initialization</a><a class="headerlink" href="#cluster-initialization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>On cluster initialization, so far only the node daemon certificate was
created. With our design, two certificates (and corresponding keys)
need to be created, a server certificate to be distributed to all nodes
and a client certificate only to be used by this particular node. In the
following, we use the term node daemon certificate for the server
certficate only.</p>
<p>In the cluster configuration, the candidate map is created. It is
populated with the respective entry for the master node. It is also
written to ssconf.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="re-adding-nodes">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">(Re-)Adding nodes</a><a class="headerlink" href="#re-adding-nodes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When a node is added, the server certificate is copied to the node (as
before). Additionally, a new client certificate (and the corresponding
private key) is created on the new node to be used only by the new node
as client certifcate.</p>
<p>If the new node is a master candidate, the candidate map is extended by
the new node&#8217;s data. As before, the updated configuration is distributed
to all nodes (as complete configuration on the master candidates and
ssconf on all nodes). Note that distribution of the configuration after
adding a node is already implemented, since all nodes hold the list of
nodes in the cluster in ssconf anyway.</p>
<p>If the configuration for whatever reason already holds an entry for this
node, it will be overriden.</p>
<p>When readding a node, the procedure is the same as for adding a node.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="promotion-and-demotion-of-master-candidates">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id14">Promotion and demotion of master candidates</a><a class="headerlink" href="#promotion-and-demotion-of-master-candidates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When a normal node gets promoted to be master candidate, an entry to the
candidate map has to be added and the updated configuration has to be
distributed to all nodes. If there was already an entry for the node,
we override it.</p>
<p>On demotion of a master candidate, the node&#8217;s entry in the candidate map
gets removed and the updated configuration gets redistibuted.</p>
<p>The same procedure applied to onlining and offlining master candidates.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id15">Cluster verify</a><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Cluster verify will be extended by the following checks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Whether each entry in the candidate map indeed corresponds to a master
candidate.</li>
<li>Whether the master candidate&#8217;s certificate digest match their entry
in the candidate map.</li>
<li>Whether no node tries to use the certificate of another node. In
particular, it is important to check that no normal node tries to
use the certificate of a master candidate.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="crypto-renewal">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id16">Crypto renewal</a><a class="headerlink" href="#crypto-renewal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Currently, when the cluster&#8217;s cryptographic tokens are renewed using the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnt-cluster</span> <span class="pre">renew-crypto</span></tt> command the node daemon certificate is
renewed (among others). Option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--new-cluster-certificate</span></tt> renews the
node daemon certificate only.</p>
<p>By adding an option <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--new-node-certificates</span></tt> we offer to renew the
client certificate. Whenever the client certificates are renewed, the
candidate map has to be updated and redistributed.</p>
<p>If for whatever reason, the candidate map becomes inconsistent, for example
due inconsistent updating after a demotion or offlining), the user can use
this option to renew the client certificates and update the candidate
certificate map.</p>

<div class="section" id="further-considerations">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id17">Further considerations</a><a class="headerlink" href="#further-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="watcher">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id18">Watcher</a><a class="headerlink" href="#watcher" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The watcher is a script that is run on all nodes in regular intervals. The
changes proposed in this design will not affect the watcher&#8217;s implementation,
because it behaves differently on the master than on non-master nodes.</p>
<p>Only on the master, it issues query calls which would require a client
certificate of a node in the candidate mapping. This is the case for the
master node. On non-master node, it&#8217;s only external communication is done via
the ConfD protocol, which uses the hmac key, which is present on all nodes.
Besides that, the watcher does not make any ssh connections, and thus is
not affected by the changes in ssh key handling either.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-keys-and-daemons">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id19">Other Keys and Daemons</a><a class="headerlink" href="#other-keys-and-daemons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Ganeti handles a couple of other keys/certificates that have not been mentioned
in this design so far. Also, other daemons than the ones mentioned so far
perform intra-cluster communication. Neither the keys nor the daemons will
be affected by this design for several reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The hmac key used by ConfD (see <a class="reference internal" href="design-2.1.html"><em>Ganeti 2.1 design</em></a>): the hmac key is still
distributed to all nodes, because it was designed to be used for
communicating with ConfD, which should be possible from all nodes.
For example, the monitoring daemon which runs on all nodes uses it to
retrieve information from ConfD. However, since communication with ConfD
is read-only, a compromised node holding the hmac key does not enable an
attacker to change the cluster&#8217;s state.</li>
<li>The WConfD daemon writes the configuration to all master candidates
via RPC. Since it only runs on the master node, it&#8217;s ability to run
RPC requests is maintained with this design.</li>
<li>The rapi SSL key certificate and rapi user/password file &#8216;rapi_users&#8217; is
already only copied to the master candidates (see <a class="reference internal" href="design-2.1.html"><em>Ganeti 2.1 design</em></a>,
Section <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Redistribute</span> <span class="pre">Config</span></tt>).</li>
<li>The spice certificates are still distributed to all nodes, since it should
be possible to use spice to access VMs on any cluster node.</li>
<li>The cluster domain secret is used for inter-cluster instance moves.
Since instances can be moved from any normal node of the source cluster to
any normal node of the destination cluster, the presence of this
secret on all nodes is necessary.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="related-and-future-work">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id20">Related and Future Work</a><a class="headerlink" href="#related-and-future-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>There a couple of suggestions on how to improve the SSL setup even more.
As a trade-off wrt to complexity and implementation effort, we did not
implement them yet (as of version 2.11) but describe them here for
future reference.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All SSL certificates that Ganeti uses so far are self-signed. It would
increase the security if they were signed by a common CA. There is
already a design doc for a Ganeti CA which was suggested in a
different context (related to import/export). This would also be a
benefit for the RPC calls. See design doc <a class="reference internal" href="design-impexp2.html"><em>Design for import/export version 2</em></a> for
more information. Implementing a CA is rather complex, because it
would mean also to support renewing the CA certificate and providing
and supporting infrastructure to revoke compromised certificates.</li>
<li>An extension of the previous suggestion would be to even enable the
system administrator to use an external CA. Especially in bigger
setups, where already an SSL infrastructure exists, it would be useful
if Ganeti can simply be integrated with it, rather than forcing the
user to use the Ganeti CA.</li>
<li>A lighter version of using a CA would be to use the server certificate
to sign the client certificate instead of using self-signed
certificates for both. The probleme here is that this would make
renewing the server certificate rather complicated, because all client
certificates would need to be resigned and redistributed as well,
which leads to interesting chicken-and-egg problems when this is done
via RPC calls.</li>
<li>Ganeti RPC calls are currently done without checking if the hostname
of the node complies with the common name of the certificate. This
might be a desirable feature, but would increase the effort when a
node is renamed.</li>
<li>The typical use case for SSL is to have one certificate per node
rather than one shared certificate (Ganeti&#8217;s noded server certificate)
and a client certificate. One could change the design in a way that
only one certificate per node is used, but this would require a common
CA so that the validity of the certificate can be established by every
node in the cluster.</li>
<li>With the proposed design, the serial numbers of the client
certificates are set to the node UUIDs. This is technically also not
complying to how SSL is supposed to be used, as the serial numbers
should reflect the enumeration of certificates created by the CA. Once
a CA is implemented, it might be reasonable to change this
accordingly. The implementation of the proposed design also has the
drawback of the serial number not changing even if the certificate is
replaced by a new one (for example when calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gnt-cluster</span> <span class="pre">renew-</span>
<span class="pre">crypt</span></tt>), which also does not comply to way SSL was designed to be
used.</li>
